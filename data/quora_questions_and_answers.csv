What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"We'd ask the following types/examples of questions, not all of which are considered pass/fail, but do give us a reasonable comprehensive picture of the candidate's depth in this area.

In general, pick one or two (that the candidate is good at) and keep going deeper and deeper, rather than go horizontally through some checklist. It is far more indicative of depth.

General mastery: when you really understand something (e.g., you've gone through the cycle of learning-doing-teaching-doing), you can express seemingly complex concepts in simple ways. Or you develop insightful views on things at a broader level and can explain it to others. E.g.,:
1. Discuss your views on the relationship between machine learning and statistics.

2. Talk about how Deep Learning (or XYZ method) fits (or not?) within the field.

3. Isn't it all just curve fitting? Talk about that.

4. How are kernel methods different?

5. Why do we need/want the bias term?

6. Why do we call it GLM when it's clearly non-linear? (somewhat tricky question, to be asked somewhat humorously---but extremely revealing.)

7. How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms? What are Fourier transforms, for that matter?

8. Etc.


ML skills specific: E.g.,
1. Pick an algorithm you like and walk me through the math and then the implementation of it, in pseudo-code.
2. OK now let's pick another one, maybe more advanced.
3. Discuss the meaning of the ROC curve, and write pseudo-code to generate the data for such a curve.
4. Discuss how you go about feature engineering (look for both intuition and specific evaluation techniques).
5. Etc.

Distributed systems (our needs): E.g.,
1. Discuss MapReduce (or your favorite parallelization abstraction). Why is MapReduce referred to as a ""shared-nothing"" architecture (clearly the nodes have to share something, no?) What are the advantages/disadvantages of ""shared-nothing""?
2. Pick an algorithm. Write the pseudo-code for its parallel version.
3. What are the trade-offs between closed-form and iterative implementations of an algorithm, in the context of distributed systems?
4. Etc.

Other (hands-on experience, past accomplishments, etc.):
1. Do you have experience with R (or Weka, Scikit-learn, SAS, Spark, etc.)? Tell me what you've done with that. Write some example data pipelines in that environment.
2. Tell me about a time when you ... { worked on a project involving ML ; optimized an algorithm for performance/accuracy/etc. }
3. Estimate the amount of time in your past project spent on each segment of your data mining/machine learning work.
4. Etc.

What are some important machine learning algorithms and questions that can be asked during interviews?,"You can expect to be asked questions about key machine learning concepts such as:

 * Regularization
 * Dimensionality Reduction
 * Curse of dimensionality
 * Cross validation
 * Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
Interviewers may also ask you to explain how machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM works and even explain when you’d use one algorithm over another algorithm.

Some interviews may also revolve around case studies, where the interviewer will give you a real-world problem and ask you to walk-through how you’d apply machine learning to solve it.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-important-machine-learning-algorithms-and-questions-that-can-be-asked-during-interviews?top_ans=1477743673813309,2023-06-16T22:42:00.394141+00:00,,0,Daryle Serrant,https://www.quora.com/profile/Daryle-Serrant
What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"Rather than just share a comprehensive list of questions, I thought I could add value by talking about this from a different angle.

I’ve realized that many people, when giving advice on ML interview prep, miss one of the most crucial aspects of the process: that there are actually two “parts” to the interview, representing two different types of questions you might be asked.

1. Questions about your specific knowledge of ML theory. Importantly, these are generally questions that have a particular correct answer that the interviewer is looking for. You might be asked about things like bias and variance, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, Bayes’ Theorem and how to use it, how to avoid overfitting models, and other such questions.

Of course, the above is critical. If you don’t understand the core concepts of Machine Learning, it will be tough for you to ever become an outstanding machine learning engineer, and a major company wouldn’t take a risk on hiring you - regardless of how charming your smile is.

If you’re interested, here’s a relevant list of practice questions [ https://www.educative.io/blog/top-machine-learning-interview-questions ].

However, I argue that candidates spend way too much time preparing for the above, and not enough on the second category of ML interview questions:

2. Machine Learning system design questions. These are open-ended questions that don’t have a particular correct answer you can quote. Instead, you will be asked to think about, make decisions, and explain your logic in designing a complex system.

Some examples of such questions include:

 * Design a search ranking system for a search engine
 * Design a recommendation system for a Netflix-like platform
 * Design a Twitter-like feed system that shows people the most relevant Tweets to them
 * Design an ad prediction system to show relevant ads to users
As you can see, questions like these require you to integrate your knowledge of ML theory with the ability to “zoom out” and think about real-world ML problems at a high level. More so than your specific solutions, interviewers are interested in hearing about how you approach such problems. What factors do you consider? What tradeoffs do you make? Why?

Your performance on questions like these makes a huge difference on not just your hire/no hire decision, but also your hiring level, which is often just as important and can make a huge difference on your salary.

There aren’t too many resources out there that will help you prepare for ML system design questions. The best one for it is Grokking the Machine Learning Interview [ https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-machine-learning-interview ], which focuses on the system design aspect of ML in depth.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-important-machine-learning-algorithms-and-questions-that-can-be-asked-during-interviews?top_ans=246647520,2020-10-29T00:43:43.510738+00:00,,172,Fahim ul Haq,https://www.quora.com/profile/Fahim-ul-Haq
What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"When I am asked to interview people, I try to ascertain whether they know the math or not, and how to apply it  in a real world context.  I also look to see if they understand high performance computing and not just vanilla coding.  

I was asked to do this as a consultant, acting as a subject matter expert to help interview junior people for the firm.  

In our interviews, we asked a candidate to present some code they had written and to talk through it.   For an ML person, it would be some kind of ML code.

So, for example, I was involved with an interview with a Physics PhD from MIT discussing some NMF code he wrote in javascript.   The javascript was very good and he would be fine doing GUI work , Node.JS work, etc.  Certainly not something I could do.

Can he do Machine Learning.  Mind you, he has a PhD in a math heavy subject from one of the top 10 schools in the world.  So he should know the math.

I wanted to see if he knew how to get it to converge properly.  He did not.     He knew it was non-convex, but he did not know how to seed it, nor did he know about the convex variants. He tried to give me some nonsense about it being Bi-convex and whatnot. Dude, just use Kmeans++  to seed it.  Thats it.  Thats all you had to say.   This got totally past the VP of engineering and the CTO.    (They were just impressed that machine learning involved computing a first order derivative--something neither had since since college calculus)

So here, he knew some basic methods, but did not really know the most important ideas in the field, the important developments,  how to really code this.  It is clear that he had never done anything like this in his former work, nor did he really understand numerical methods.

This means that his solution would never work in production and -- more importantly -- that he would have no idea how to evaluate it or how to  fix it.  I see this a lot.   Also, he did not know the available open source codes, how they worked internally, and  which one to use,  or how to evaluate their performance.  For being a PhD from MIT, this was unacceptable to me.

There was also a code evaluation.  For me, one needs to know what runs fast and what does not. What good is a method that only runs on 300 data points?!     In this case, this interviewee had written his own javascript matrix library.  Did he know the BLAS libraries and how they work?  Or an alternative?     This is critical because you can't run anything in production if the code is too slow.   I see the same problem with most ruby coders--they just don't know numerical computing.    

I was not looking to evaluate 10,000 of complex code , whether he used Agile or Unit Testing.  Nor did I care about solving some high school brain teaser. I just wanted to see a small piece of code, with good engineering choices ,   a good understanding of the math, and how to make this solution work in a modest production environment . 

Id rather see old fashioned spectral clustering with a  Fortran library, which can scale, as opposed to trying to use a ""fancy"" method like NMF or LDA if you can not get it to work in production at scale.  (I'm not saying they don't scale--I am saying you better know how to get them to scale if you choose to use them)

In another interview, again a PhD (Ukrainian I think) who was very bright and had solved some good problems and had experience.  He was using an off-the-shelf SVM tool--a tool I know very well.   I asked a very basic question--how do you adjust the cost parameter for the SVM regularizer.   I rephrased the question a couple of different ways to give him a chance.    FAIL   In other words, did you read the documentation of the tool and did you understand which parameters to tweak and which ones to leave at the default settings  ( I kinda would like the person to have read the entire source code of the tool and know how it works. )   Again, this demonstrates a failure of the most basic mathematical concepts in ML -- Regularization-- and how they would apply in production.  Tuning this parameter can increase accuracy by %10-15 (or more).  Again, just simple stuff--but important stuff  This also shows a lack of attention to notice the important details of the work.  We actually offered this guy the job and he asked for a salary way out of the ballpark.  If he had not missed this critical question he might have been able to make the case for the salary.


Having shared all this, I would add that I think , for you, the market is very good and you will probably not encounter anything like this.  Why?  All you need to do is know more machine learning than the VP and the CTO--and here the bar is very low.   Everyone and his brother has a funding to do machine learning and they usually just need to solve one small problem and get the product out the door.  Most  (i.e 7/10 ) CTOs and VPs know absolutely nothing about even basic   machine learning  so they have no clue  even what to  ask. (Newton Raphson will blow them away, and they will think you are too expensive if you try compare stochastic gradient descent to interior point methods)  They got their start up funded based on the market potential of  the idea, and they are expected to hire people to invent their IP. 

  (Obviously if you are interviewing at Google or Lockheed Martin, disregard all of this and hire me once you get in)

P.S.   I was asked once by some VP/CTO evaluating me what the volume of a rectangular prism is.  AlI could think of was this old Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon  with the Prism on it 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon

I would never ask this kind of question but you will probably get asked many   puzzle questions like this if you are fresh out of school (or an old man like me I guess)  I seem to recall there are books and/or web sites with tons of these.

"How do I answer ""What's the best machine learning algorithm"" in a data science interview?","I would be surprised if this question was asked during a data science interview because the answer is so obvious -- there is no ""best"" ml algorithm. It all depends on many aspects of the problem domain. The question can only be determined after considerable work is done including exploratory data analysis to better understand the available data. Only then can you reasonably choose an algorithm. Even then, I've seen cases when you may want to change a previously selected algorithm based on changing elements in the problem space.

Which are the popular algorithms asked in tech interviews?,"If the expectation is to see an encyclopedia of algorithms or techniques listed out as answers here, you'd likely be disappointed. There are really infinite possibilities for questions in tech interviews across companies in the world. A large number of new questions are invented everyday. There is nothing like a 'list of questions' that when leaked in here, is guaranteed to help you ace through interviews.

One's best bet to crack tech interviews, would be to 'try and understand' the fundamentals of algorithms, data structures and complexity calculations, and try and 'apply' this knowledge to problems in tech interviews. Also translate this into code and try that out. Definitely familiarize oneself with the basic techniques (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, graph algos, etc...) and the fundamental data structures (search trees, lists, stack, graphs, etc...).

Which are the popular algorithms asked in tech interviews?,"It’s impossible to be certain which algorithm you’ll be asked in a technical interview, and preparing by only focusing on “popular” ones is not the best method to make sure you’re ready. Study lots of different algorithms, work on coding projects in your free time, do as many practice problems as you can, and invest time reading forums, doing MOOCs and other work to prepare.

The biggest challenge isn’t determining exactly what will be asked to you during your coding interview, it’s staying consistent in the time leading up to the interview. You have to put in an immense amount of work in order to be ready for a technical interview, especially for the tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook. To stay on task and focused, find a way to schedule practice into your routine. If you’re currently employed, make sure you reserve blocks of time during your weekends and after work for preparation. If you aren’t employed, take your interview prep as seriously as you would a job, and do as much as you can.

Another way to hold yourself accountable is to schedule mock coding interviews. This is an excellent way to practice, because it gives you a good feeling of how the real interview environment will be. Use platforms like Pramp [ https://www.pramp.com/ref/q034812 ] and InterviewCake [ http://www.interviewcake.com/ ] to be paired with another software engineer to practice full mock interviews. Not only will you complete coding problems, you can also practice the communication portion of the interview, which is a crucial component you can’t forget about. You’ll get feedback from your partner, which will be useful in shaping your interview strategy for the real thing.

What types of technical questions are most commonly asked in Senior Machine Learning Engineer interviews?,"Every place I’ve interviewed with or worked at had a similar process.

As an aside, Microsoft uses me as an interview resource. Internal Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to set up or participate in interviews outside of Microsoft so when a client asks them, they’ll use outside resources.

Here’s the basic process.

They have a phone screen to ascertain your technical acumen.

Our phone screen is all data. Here’s a short list to prepare you for the phone screen. [ https://www.machinelearningmike.com/post/phone-screen-preparation ]

All of our models are on structured data and we use BigQuery so if you don’t have strong data skills, we end the phone screen. Most companies do the same thing. We actually won’t interview anyone without 3–5 years of SQL in a real-world setting. Teaching data skills is far more difficult than Python or modeling basics.

So, we start easy.

What are the two types of SQL?

What’s a relational database?

What’s a table?

What the difference between structured data and unstructured data?

How do you create a table?

In the phone screen, we also throw in a few Python questions. Easy shit… like what does a single equals sign mean? What’s an equality operator? What’s a model called in SciKit-Learn.

If you make it past the phone screen you have your first in-person.

This is where we dive into machine learning. Again, starting off simple like… can you whiteboard out the machine learning pipeline?

Can you draw a simple ANN? What’s the difference between deep learning and an ANN?

After the candidate makes it past these it’s on to coding questions in Python, Pandas, SciKit-Learn.

Then basic stats questions. All applied questions.

Then I’ll put up Jupyter Notebook with an end to end pipeline and have them walk me through each line of code.

Like…

import pandas as pd %3CTell me what every word means.

The word import means to “bring in”

Pandas is a library for data manipulation.

as pd is an alias. An alias is used so you don’t have to write out the entire library during the call.

We have about 100 questions. It’s really important to understand, companies aren’t going to pay you 200K to learn on the job.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-important-machine-learning-algorithms-and-questions-that-can-be-asked-during-interviews?top_ans=190355055,2020-01-05T20:18:07.193777+00:00,2020-01-24T21:29:24.650467+00:00,200,Mike West,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-West-99

What questions are asked in interviews?,"There are some basic questions for which you can prepare and then there are some questions which are completely guided by your responses. You have to play with your mind and prepare for them beforehand just like we prepare attack lines in chess. 

Here are some questions which you must prepare :

Q.  Tell me some thing about yourself.
This is the question from where YOU can direct the panel and urge them to ask the questions from your specific interest.

Q. Why do you want to join this institute?
This is one question you should answer honestly and pragmatically. Ideally you should choose an institute based on certain criteria. Such as Ranking/ placements, Courses offered, Fee, Location

Do some research, ask from your seniors. An informed analysis of the institute can convince the interviewer that you are sincerely interested.

Q. Which other institutes have you applied to?
This is a question that is very much linked to the previous question. For example, if you say that you had chosen IRMA because you have a flair for Rural Marketing and while answering this question you don't mention  the name of other institutes known to offer quality course in Rural Marketing you are in trouble. So these two questions are to be prepared simultaneously avoiding conflicts in answers.

Q. How will you add value to this institute if you make it through?
This is an opportunity to showcase your strengths but remember it is essential that your strengths should be supported by related achievements.Give a real life example to convince the panel.
Your background and circumstances can also be your strengths and can be used as equally important points in supporting your answer.
Remember, an achievement doesn't necessarily mean a prize. It can also be your successfully coming out of a crisis situation or you managing to run a small project with your friends.

Q. What do you consider your greatest weakness?
CAUTION: This is not an opportunity to pour out your darkest secrets. This is a question that is best played down. For example, if you are overweight, you may mention -- ""I have been trying to shed weight for the last  few years but couldn't do it still."" The answer should be framed so that it does not reflect badly on your career thus far, or your future career.

Another way of answering would be a smart statement: ""I have never allowed failure to drag me down. I just got up, took my lesson and picked my way forward."" Here it would help to have a certain experience picked  out.      

Most career books tell you to select a strength and present it as a weakness. Such as: “I work too much. I just work and work and work.” Wrong. First of all, using a strength and presenting it as a weakness is  deceiving. Second, it misses the point of the question.

You should select a weakness that you have been actively working to overcome. For example: “I have had trouble in the past with planning and prioritization. However, I’m now taking steps to correct this. I just started  using a pocket planner . . .” then show them your planner and how you are using it.
     
Talk about a true weakness and show what you are doing to overcome it.

Q. Why have you chosen this career?
This is an area where a mature and realistic answer is expected. People choose their career based on several reasons, such as:

What is your aptitude?
What kind of a social, professional and personal environment do you desire?
What is your background and achievements?
What motivates you?
What activities do you enjoy?

Q. What is the last book you read?
Many experts would tell you that you should know the ins and out of the books and everything about the author and his writing style. If you know these facts, it can't hurt, but if you are not the kind of a person who  would research the background and other facts about books, but read for fun, it is okay to mention it. The only thing is that your answer should be natural, convincing and rational.

For example, if the interviewer asks you for more detail about the author you may just reply.

""I'm sorry but I haven't read much about the author. But I liked this book because...""

Q. How will your contribute to this campus if we select you?
This is a question that directly relates to your strengths and aspiration. Take this as an opportunity to showcase the various qualities that you possess which may benefit the college, academically, culturally or in any  other way.

Q.  Where do you see yourself 10 years from now?
This is not when you start throwing in fancy designations. Instead, concentrate on the kind of roles people in those designations are expected to play. If the question specifically asks for your professional goals then  stick to it, otherwise it is a good idea to balance it with your personal goals.       

Q. Who is your role model?
Your role model can be anyone a public figure or even someone from your family. It is a good idea to know a lot about the person you would make your role model. It is important to focus on the qualities that inspire  you and how you try to inculcate those qualities in yourself. It is always important to tell why s/he is different from her/his peers.

Q.If you had to live your life over again, what one thing would you change?
Focus on a key turning point in your life or missed opportunity. Yet also tie it forward to what you are doing to still seek to make that change.
      For example: “Although I’m overall very happy with where I’m at in my life, the one aspect I likely would have changed would be focusing earlier on my chosen career. I had a great internship this past year and look  forward to more experience in the field. I simply wish I would have focused here earlier.
For example, I learned on my recent internship…” …then provide examples.
      Stay focused on positive direction in your life and back it up with examples.

Q. Do your have any questions for me?
""No"" would be a bad answer. It is good to have a few questions that relate to the academic and cultural environment of the institution. This will show your enthusiasm.

3 Mistakes MBA aspirants make!

1. Blaming your College/School Professor for low scores: You are always 100% responsible for your grades. If you have low scores then don’t ever state that your teacher did not clarify the subject or rushed the topic.  Do you think studies at IIM’s or any MBA institutes are designed to be studied in an easy relaxed spoon fed manner? Wrong the MBA curriculum is a real test of your abilities to stay awake and perform at your best. If  you blame your teachers - you are out.

2. Blaming ill health: What are you LOSER NO 1? If exam days give you bad health, how will you be able to achieve corporate profit targets? Unless you are actually physically handicapped you cannot be expected to  fall ill under mysterious circumstances whenever pressure builds around you. Even if you were truly sick - try to come out with some other reason for your lack of extra curricular activities or low scores.

3. State hobbies just for the heck of it: OK so you enjoy cricket. Do you know the technical details of the game? How many members are there in the BCCI governing council? The IIM professors do not appreciate  mere couch potatoes. Hobbies are not merely for adding spice to your CV. State only 2 hobbies and try to learn everything there is to that hobby.

The MBA Personal Interview is actually tougher than job interviews. In job interviews they actually need manpower so they don’t ask tough questions. Here you are being SHORTLISTED against equally capable  competitors so they are trying to find means to NOT SELECT you. So be careful with your replies.

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"We'd ask the following types/examples of questions, not all of which are considered pass/fail, but do give us a reasonable comprehensive picture of the candidate's depth in this area.

In general, pick one or two (that the candidate is good at) and keep going deeper and deeper, rather than go horizontally through some checklist. It is far more indicative of depth.

General mastery: when you really understand something (e.g., you've gone through the cycle of learning-doing-teaching-doing), you can express seemingly complex concepts in simple ways. Or you develop insightful views on things at a broader level and can explain it to others. E.g.,:
1. Discuss your views on the relationship between machine learning and statistics.

2. Talk about how Deep Learning (or XYZ method) fits (or not?) within the field.

3. Isn't it all just curve fitting? Talk about that.

4. How are kernel methods different?

5. Why do we need/want the bias term?

6. Why do we call it GLM when it's clearly non-linear? (somewhat tricky question, to be asked somewhat humorously---but extremely revealing.)

7. How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms? What are Fourier transforms, for that matter?

8. Etc.


ML skills specific: E.g.,
1. Pick an algorithm you like and walk me through the math and then the implementation of it, in pseudo-code.
2. OK now let's pick another one, maybe more advanced.
3. Discuss the meaning of the ROC curve, and write pseudo-code to generate the data for such a curve.
4. Discuss how you go about feature engineering (look for both intuition and specific evaluation techniques).
5. Etc.

Distributed systems (our needs): E.g.,
1. Discuss MapReduce (or your favorite parallelization abstraction). Why is MapReduce referred to as a ""shared-nothing"" architecture (clearly the nodes have to share something, no?) What are the advantages/disadvantages of ""shared-nothing""?
2. Pick an algorithm. Write the pseudo-code for its parallel version.
3. What are the trade-offs between closed-form and iterative implementations of an algorithm, in the context of distributed systems?
4. Etc.

Other (hands-on experience, past accomplishments, etc.):
1. Do you have experience with R (or Weka, Scikit-learn, SAS, Spark, etc.)? Tell me what you've done with that. Write some example data pipelines in that environment.
2. Tell me about a time when you ... { worked on a project involving ML ; optimized an algorithm for performance/accuracy/etc. }
3. Estimate the amount of time in your past project spent on each segment of your data mining/machine learning work.
4. Etc.

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"Rather than just share a comprehensive list of questions, I thought I could add value by talking about this from a different angle.

I’ve realized that many people, when giving advice on ML interview prep, miss one of the most crucial aspects of the process: that there are actually two “parts” to the interview, representing two different types of questions you might be asked.

1. Questions about your specific knowledge of ML theory. Importantly, these are generally questions that have a particular correct answer that the interviewer is looking for. You might be asked about things like bias and variance, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, Bayes’ Theorem and how to use it, how to avoid overfitting models, and other such questions.

Of course, the above is critical. If you don’t understand the core concepts of Machine Learning, it will be tough for you to ever become an outstanding machine learning engineer, and a major company wouldn’t take a risk on hiring you - regardless of how charming your smile is.

If you’re interested, here’s a relevant list of practice questions [ https://www.educative.io/blog/top-machine-learning-interview-questions ].

However, I argue that candidates spend way too much time preparing for the above, and not enough on the second category of ML interview questions:

2. Machine Learning system design questions. These are open-ended questions that don’t have a particular correct answer you can quote. Instead, you will be asked to think about, make decisions, and explain your logic in designing a complex system.

Some examples of such questions include:

 * Design a search ranking system for a search engine
 * Design a recommendation system for a Netflix-like platform
 * Design a Twitter-like feed system that shows people the most relevant Tweets to them
 * Design an ad prediction system to show relevant ads to users
As you can see, questions like these require you to integrate your knowledge of ML theory with the ability to “zoom out” and think about real-world ML problems at a high level. More so than your specific solutions, interviewers are interested in hearing about how you approach such problems. What factors do you consider? What tradeoffs do you make? Why?

Your performance on questions like these makes a huge difference on not just your hire/no hire decision, but also your hiring level, which is often just as important and can make a huge difference on your salary.

There aren’t too many resources out there that will help you prepare for ML system design questions. The best one for it is Grokking the Machine Learning Interview [ https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-machine-learning-interview ], which focuses on the system design aspect of ML in depth.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-machine-learning-interview-questions?top_ans=246647520,2020-10-29T00:43:43.510738+00:00,,172,Fahim ul Haq,https://www.quora.com/profile/Fahim-ul-Haq
What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"I think a lot of people dont know how to properly conduct a data science interview - mostly because they dont understand what to look for themselves - how do you ask someone about something you know very little about?

First off, Data Scientist is going to be an EXTREMELY different position for a startup vs a large company (i.e. GOOGLE / IBM Research). Most likely, for a large organization, the problems you'll be focusing on are a bit more constrained, versus in a startup, it will probably be like ""we need a first version of classification / recommendation / etc"" models.

In a startup, you'll more likely than not want someone who has both data wrangling skills (depending, Pig / Python / SQL etc) as well as having used standard ML libraries, although this will **somewhat** apply to a large company. The thing is, the large company has resources to do more novel exploration, whereas few startups will take risks to invent something completely novel.

Anyway, the right way to conduct a data science interview is to create a dataset (i.e. from a Kaggle, etc) that resembles the problem you want to solve, and have the 'scientist' work through the different steps from start to finish of what they would do -

what data would they choose?
how would they clean the data?
What types of features? How could features be enhanced with domain knowledge?
what model would they use? why / why not?
what evaluation metrics? (f1 / recall / precision, etc)
What are other papers saying about this? What is the academic benchmark for a problem like this?
Who in academia has presented papers on this type of problem?
etc.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-machine-learning-interview-questions?top_ans=5276579,2014-05-25T19:10:18.545181+00:00,,36,Nathan Artz,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nathan-Artz
What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"Amazon came to our campus to offer Data Science internships last October. After clearing the Machine Learning interview and shortlisting coding round, I was offered a data science internship of 5 months duration. Apart from that, I had applied at Walmart Labs off-campus for the position of Data Scientist and fortunately, was able to convert it.

Some of the questions that I have been asked in the ML interview for above two companies are:

1. Explain Linear and Logistic Regression. List their assumptions. Why cannot we use Linear Regression on categorical output?
2. Explain Bias-Variance Tradeoff. Explain underfitting and overfitting. What is the need for regularization?
3. Explain variants of Gradient Descent and the pros and cons of each variant.
4. Difference between Bagging and Boosting. Explain Random Forest.
5. Explain Precision and Recall measures and give examples of use cases where each is measured.
6. Briefly discuss some dimension reduction techniques. Difference between PCA and SVD.
7. Explain ROC Curve. What do the axes of the ROC Curve represent? Elaborate on the two extreme points of the ROC Curve – (0, 0) and (1, 1).
8. Explain AUC and its physical interpretation? Is it possible to get AUC below 0.5? What is the worst AUC that you can possibly achieve?
9. Explain the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients. Briefly describe some methods to solve these.
10. What is the need for a pooling layer in CNNs? Difference between max pooling and average pooling.
11. Explain how will you forecast a time series? Can we perform Linear Regression on time-series data?
12. What is Central Limit Theorem? Give an example where it is used.
13. Why is hyperparameter tuning required? Elaborate on some common hyperparameters for tree-based models.
14. Briefly discuss some clustering methods. What are the drawbacks of K-Means Clustering?
15. Differentiate between generative and discriminative models and give examples of each.
Another thing to note is that I wasn’t asked questions specifically on my academic ML projects that I did during the course during my interviews in the Walmart process. I was briefly asked about my work at Amazon at the end of 2nd round and about my projects in Computer Vision in the 3rd round.

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"When I am asked to interview people, I try to ascertain whether they know the math or not, and how to apply it  in a real world context.  I also look to see if they understand high performance computing and not just vanilla coding.  

I was asked to do this as a consultant, acting as a subject matter expert to help interview junior people for the firm.  

In our interviews, we asked a candidate to present some code they had written and to talk through it.   For an ML person, it would be some kind of ML code.

So, for example, I was involved with an interview with a Physics PhD from MIT discussing some NMF code he wrote in javascript.   The javascript was very good and he would be fine doing GUI work , Node.JS work, etc.  Certainly not something I could do.

Can he do Machine Learning.  Mind you, he has a PhD in a math heavy subject from one of the top 10 schools in the world.  So he should know the math.

I wanted to see if he knew how to get it to converge properly.  He did not.     He knew it was non-convex, but he did not know how to seed it, nor did he know about the convex variants. He tried to give me some nonsense about it being Bi-convex and whatnot. Dude, just use Kmeans++  to seed it.  Thats it.  Thats all you had to say.   This got totally past the VP of engineering and the CTO.    (They were just impressed that machine learning involved computing a first order derivative--something neither had since since college calculus)

So here, he knew some basic methods, but did not really know the most important ideas in the field, the important developments,  how to really code this.  It is clear that he had never done anything like this in his former work, nor did he really understand numerical methods.

This means that his solution would never work in production and -- more importantly -- that he would have no idea how to evaluate it or how to  fix it.  I see this a lot.   Also, he did not know the available open source codes, how they worked internally, and  which one to use,  or how to evaluate their performance.  For being a PhD from MIT, this was unacceptable to me.

There was also a code evaluation.  For me, one needs to know what runs fast and what does not. What good is a method that only runs on 300 data points?!     In this case, this interviewee had written his own javascript matrix library.  Did he know the BLAS libraries and how they work?  Or an alternative?     This is critical because you can't run anything in production if the code is too slow.   I see the same problem with most ruby coders--they just don't know numerical computing.    

I was not looking to evaluate 10,000 of complex code , whether he used Agile or Unit Testing.  Nor did I care about solving some high school brain teaser. I just wanted to see a small piece of code, with good engineering choices ,   a good understanding of the math, and how to make this solution work in a modest production environment . 

Id rather see old fashioned spectral clustering with a  Fortran library, which can scale, as opposed to trying to use a ""fancy"" method like NMF or LDA if you can not get it to work in production at scale.  (I'm not saying they don't scale--I am saying you better know how to get them to scale if you choose to use them)

In another interview, again a PhD (Ukrainian I think) who was very bright and had solved some good problems and had experience.  He was using an off-the-shelf SVM tool--a tool I know very well.   I asked a very basic question--how do you adjust the cost parameter for the SVM regularizer.   I rephrased the question a couple of different ways to give him a chance.    FAIL   In other words, did you read the documentation of the tool and did you understand which parameters to tweak and which ones to leave at the default settings  ( I kinda would like the person to have read the entire source code of the tool and know how it works. )   Again, this demonstrates a failure of the most basic mathematical concepts in ML -- Regularization-- and how they would apply in production.  Tuning this parameter can increase accuracy by %10-15 (or more).  Again, just simple stuff--but important stuff  This also shows a lack of attention to notice the important details of the work.  We actually offered this guy the job and he asked for a salary way out of the ballpark.  If he had not missed this critical question he might have been able to make the case for the salary.


Having shared all this, I would add that I think , for you, the market is very good and you will probably not encounter anything like this.  Why?  All you need to do is know more machine learning than the VP and the CTO--and here the bar is very low.   Everyone and his brother has a funding to do machine learning and they usually just need to solve one small problem and get the product out the door.  Most  (i.e 7/10 ) CTOs and VPs know absolutely nothing about even basic   machine learning  so they have no clue  even what to  ask. (Newton Raphson will blow them away, and they will think you are too expensive if you try compare stochastic gradient descent to interior point methods)  They got their start up funded based on the market potential of  the idea, and they are expected to hire people to invent their IP. 

  (Obviously if you are interviewing at Google or Lockheed Martin, disregard all of this and hire me once you get in)

P.S.   I was asked once by some VP/CTO evaluating me what the volume of a rectangular prism is.  AlI could think of was this old Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon  with the Prism on it 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon

I would never ask this kind of question but you will probably get asked many   puzzle questions like this if you are fresh out of school (or an old man like me I guess)  I seem to recall there are books and/or web sites with tons of these.

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"Machine learning interview questions usually involve bringing up a real-world problem and asking the candidate how to solve it. The type of the question varies a lot depending on the field of the company.

An image processing company may ask you “how can you find all the images which are a photo of a landscape?”. A video processing company may ask you “In a video of a soccer match, how can you mark all the times that a certain player is in the view?”. A speech processing company may ask you “Among a large number of voicemails, how can you detect the ones that an old woman is talking?”. An NLP company might ask you “How would you provide suggestions for the next word in an incomplete sentence?”. An online shopping company may ask you “how would you store products in fixed-size bins where people are most likely to buy them together?”.

There are so many use cases and many of these types of questions which may be asked. I suggest that before the interview you read about a few case studies which relates to the company’s business. For example if it’s an image processing company, read about popular approaches for image detection, identification, segmentation, tracking, clustering, etc.

Also, there are a few things which you are expected to know and are shared among almost all use cases. You should have ideas how to approach scenarios like this:

 * How to use labeled and unlabeled data?
 * What if you don’t have any labeled data?
 * What if your data set is skewed (e.g. 99.99 % positive and 0.01% negative labels)?
 * How to test and know whether or not we have overfitting problem?
 * How to avoid overfitting?
 * How to make training faster?
 * How to make predictions faster?
Also, It’s very common in machine learning interviews that they ask you about a previous machine learning work that you have done in details. You need to be able to explain what challenges you were facing and how you solved them.

At the end, I’d like to introduce our incredible service which may be helpful for people who are preparing for machine learning interviews: It’s www.techmockinterview.com . We launched this service a few months ago and it’s been very well-received. You will get a mock interview experience just like the real interview.

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"The list of questions that we will be mentioning below is only meant to introduce you to the basics machine learner. And to be honest these 10 questions are just a drop in the sea. Machine learning is continuously developing and with time, new concepts will emerge hence it will be vital that you harbor a constant urge to learn and upskill. Read Journals, join online communities, and attend ML seminars and conferences.

As the process of preparing an interview can be overwhelming, we have decided to help by curating a list of 10 commonly asked questions in ML interviews.

Let's get started!

Q1 Define Recall and Precision

Recall or true positive rate refers to the total number of positive claimed by a model as compared to the actual number of positives which are present throughout the data

Precision or positive predictive value precisely predicts the number of true positives claimed by a model compared to the number of positives it actually claims.

Q2) Why is Bayes referred to as “Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is referred to as “naive” because despite having many practical applications it is based on the assumption that it is impossible to find real-life data. All the features in a data set are independent, equal, and crucial. In the naive Bayes approach, conditional probability is computed as a pure product of the probabilities of individual components thus implying the complete independence of features. Sadly, this assumption can never occur in a real-life situation.

Q3) What are the two methods for calibration in supervised learning?

The two calibration methods are isotonic regression and Platt calibration. Both these methods are designed especially for binary classification.

Q4) What is F1 Score?

F1 score is a measure of a model’s performance that is an average of the recall of a model and precision which results nearing to 1 being the best and those nearing 0 being the worst. The F1 score can be used in classification tests that do not give priority to true negatives.

Q5) What is Ensemble learning?

It uses a combination of learning algorithms to optimize the predictive performance of models. In this, the multiple models like classifiers or experts are both strategically generated and combined to prevent Overfitting in models. It is used to enhance the classification, prediction, performance, function approximation etc. of a model.

Q6) Difference between machine learning and deep learning?

Machine learning involves the application and usage of advanced algorithms to uncover the hidden patterns within the data, parse data, and learn from it, and finally apply those learned insights to make informed business decisions. Meanwhile, Deep learning is a subset of Machine Learning that involves the use of Artificial Neural Nets which draw inspiration from the neural net structure of the human brain. Also, deep learning is used in feature detection.

Q7) What is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 errors?

Type 1 error is a false positive error that ‘claims’ that an incident has occurred when actually nothing has happened. An example of a false positive error is a false fire alarm. The alarm starts ringing even though there’s no fire. Type 2 error is a false negative error that ‘claims’ nothing has occurred when something has surely happened. Type 2 error would be to tell a pregnant lady that she isn’t carrying a baby.

Q8) Explain the variance and bias of the term.

The error of a learning algorithm during the process of training is decomposed into two parts – bias and variance. Variance denotes an error caused because of the complexity of that learning algorithm in data analyzation while bias is an error situation caused due to the use of simple assumptions in the learning algorithm. Variance is measured by how much the learning algorithm’s prediction varies for different training data sets and bias measures the proximity of the average classifier which is created by the learning algorithm to the target function.

Q9) Why do you prune a Decision Tree?

They are pruned to get rid of the branches with weak predictive abilities. Pruning can be either done from the top-down or bottom-up. It helps to minimize the complexity quotient of the Decision Tree model and optimize its predictive accuracy. Cost-complexity pruning, minimum error pruning, reduced error pruning, error complexity pruning are some of the used Decision Tree pruning methods.

Q10) How would you handle corrupted or missing data in a dataset?

You must drop the rows and columns or replace them with other values. Pandas library has two methods to find missing or corrupted data - dropna() and isnull(. These functions help find the rows/columns of data with corrupted data and drop those values.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-machine-learning-interview-questions?top_ans=224848526,2020-06-30T13:01:46.236076+00:00,,4,upGrad,https://www.quora.com/profile/upGrad
What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"Machine Learning interviews are more logic-oriented than concept-based. The interviewer doesn’t want a specific answer from you but he wants to know how strong your logical thinking is. You would be asked to explain your thought process, your observations and suggestions.

Instead of asking you different concepts, the interviewer will generally focus on one algorithm or language and go deeper into it. So, you should be prepared to convey your thoughts properly and demonstrate the skills mentioned in the Job Description.

In my 6 years of experience as an AI/ML Architect, I have realized that these are the most important questions you should prepare for:

General Questions:

 * What is supervised learning?
 * What according to you is the most important ML skill?
 * How is ML connected to AI and Deep Learning?
 * What are some methods to handle missing data?
ML Specific Questions:

 * Explain the working principles of common ML algorithms like linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.
 * What are common evaluation metrics for classification problems (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)?
 * What are the common techniques in unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)?
 * What are the activation functions in deep learning?
 * What are the ethical considerations in machine learning?
 * How would you design an ad prediction system to show relevant ads to users?
Project-based questions:

 * Please elaborate on the dataset [data pipeline] you used in this specific project.
 * Do you think this is the most optimized approach for the problem?
 * If you could change one thing in this project, what would it be?
Remember, the interviewer will test your answer later and how you get to the answer at first. Try appearing for mock interviews to evaluate your thought process and appear confident in real-life interviews.

If you are preparing for interviews, I recommend starting your preparation from the beginning. In addition, you can connect with me to receive personalized guidance from Day 1. I can help you understand everything from scratch, including preparing the right questions and practicing

them through continuous mock interviews, as well as applying for jobs.

What types of technical questions are most commonly asked in Senior Machine Learning Engineer interviews?,"Every place I’ve interviewed with or worked at had a similar process.

As an aside, Microsoft uses me as an interview resource. Internal Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to set up or participate in interviews outside of Microsoft so when a client asks them, they’ll use outside resources.

Here’s the basic process.

They have a phone screen to ascertain your technical acumen.

Our phone screen is all data. Here’s a short list to prepare you for the phone screen. [ https://www.machinelearningmike.com/post/phone-screen-preparation ]

All of our models are on structured data and we use BigQuery so if you don’t have strong data skills, we end the phone screen. Most companies do the same thing. We actually won’t interview anyone without 3–5 years of SQL in a real-world setting. Teaching data skills is far more difficult than Python or modeling basics.

So, we start easy.

What are the two types of SQL?

What’s a relational database?

What’s a table?

What the difference between structured data and unstructured data?

How do you create a table?

In the phone screen, we also throw in a few Python questions. Easy shit… like what does a single equals sign mean? What’s an equality operator? What’s a model called in SciKit-Learn.

If you make it past the phone screen you have your first in-person.

This is where we dive into machine learning. Again, starting off simple like… can you whiteboard out the machine learning pipeline?

Can you draw a simple ANN? What’s the difference between deep learning and an ANN?

After the candidate makes it past these it’s on to coding questions in Python, Pandas, SciKit-Learn.

Then basic stats questions. All applied questions.

Then I’ll put up Jupyter Notebook with an end to end pipeline and have them walk me through each line of code.

Like…

import pandas as pd %3CTell me what every word means.

The word import means to “bring in”

Pandas is a library for data manipulation.

as pd is an alias. An alias is used so you don’t have to write out the entire library during the call.

What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?,"I ask them to attack some common machine learning problems from the web domain that most machine learning researchers should have heard of.  It can be hard to bring people up to speed on your problem domain during a short interview, so I try to ask more familiar questions like ""How would you approach the Netflix Prize?"", ""How would you generate related searches on Bing?"", ""How would you suggest followers on Twitter?"".

I ask them to describe a ""Rolls Royce"" solution that you could implement in 3 months, then a version you could implement in 3 weeks, and another version you could implement if you only had 3 days.  This tells you how adaptable they are and if they can come up with pragmatic approaches.

Most of the things we build need to scale, so I probe them about how their approach would work on large amounts of data.  MapReduce based solutions are nice to see when appropriate.

I also ask some theory questions like Josh suggested along with a few real world ML challenges we face to see if they have any creative solutions.  Since my group is very product focused and team members are self directed, I also try to get a sense of whether the candidate can come up with new products themselves that will make a difference for the company and our users.

** Another type of question I often ask involves finding or collecting your own training data.  Most applicants have only worked with toy datasets or data where the labeled examples were provided to them.  I pose a typical machine learning problem they might face, and ask how they would quickly gather additional data to help solve it.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-machine-learning-interview-questions?top_ans=85281,2010-08-17T23:55:24.117976+00:00,2010-10-11T08:21:17.136060+00:00,389,Peter Skomoroch,https://www.quora.com/profile/Peter-Skomoroch
What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?,"I try to ask very basic but fundamental questions to see if they actually understand the math

 I would expect everyone to know how to solve

Ax=b

And to know the difference between a convex and non-convex solution.


Finding any reasonable candidate is quite hard, and the real goal is to disqualify people.  This is usually enough to weed out %90 of the posers.

Also, there are lots of ways to solve the same problem, and ML is a big field.
Keeping it simple and basic is important. 

At this point, it might be useful to ask about regularization.  It's enough to understand that A^{-1} is ill conditioned; although that would weed out %99 of the candidates, and no one could fill the role.  

I generally don't ask questions like ""implement logistic regression"" unless the job actual involved writing custom solvers since doing this well is hard, and implementing a simple solution is pointless  counterproductive. (I have seen new hires try this and fall flat on their a$$).  

 I would rather they know how that running NMF will bomb out if you don't seed it properly, how to adjust the cost parameter on liblinear , or just knowing what Newton's method is  

---

 Note that the real key to evaluate a PhD level researcher, however, is to determine if they are capable of doing independent research (if the job actually entails this), or if they just did what their advisor told them to do.   Here, one wants to see if they have a broad knowledge of the own field and how creative their PhD research was.  This is not, however, necessarily part of the interview process but more part of the screening process.

 When I evaluate a more senior person, especially an older PhD,  I use the old University of Chicago whiteboard method, meaning that anything someone brings up, they had better be able to go to the whiteboard (or chalkboard, in the old days) and work through the math.  This is absolutely critical, because it is necessary to see if you have kept yours math skills up and also to see if think using language or you think using math.   Thinking in math is hard and requires you maintain the skill.

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"I think that your interviewers will want to see some experience in ML.
I guess that this is your first job in this domain so I would suggest working on a small-medium independent open source project which will be ""cool"" and based upon an ML algo'.
Something like a facebook app, mobile app, small web site.
This will give you that needed edge over other newbies.

What are machine learning questions for beginners?,"If you are asking for interview questions then here is the list of them

 * What do you mean by machine learning
 * What is precision, recall & f1 score
 * Where do we get over-fitting in ML models.
 * What are projects you have done (Important one)
 * 
 * Based on algorithm you have used they will ask details about it like
 * 
 * Why this algorithm only?
 * Where did you get data from
 * Why that hyper-parameter?
 * What was the result
 * Any data visualisation techniques you have used?
 * On which basis you declared model fit for testing?
 * What is the concept of that algo

 * It is an endless cycle once you are into the project section. So it is better to take interviewer towards the projects. But most importantly clear all the concepts which occur into the project you show in resume.

 * Difference of Machine learning, deep learning & artificial intelligence.
 * Why machine learning & not deep learning (ML, DL can be interchanged).
 * Basics of python especially
 * 
 * String operations
 * List comprehension
 * Numpy
 * Pandas

 * Or basics of other language in which company is doing ML
I would suggest that you go for projects as many as you can & understand them better. That way you give confidence to your interviewer that you have worked on ML, DL & will learn on your own if given a hefty task.

What are the Machine Learning topics and algorithms a beginner should know?,"Hello,

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

Now talking about the topics & algorithms, a beginner should know are :—

1.) Supervised Learning

 * Regression :— Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables). We have different ML algorithms to implement Regression such as linear regression, multilinear regression etc.
 * Classification :— In statistics, classification is the problem of identifying which of a set of categories an observation, belongs to. Examples are assigning a given email to the ""spam"" or ""non-spam"" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient. Some of the most used classification algorithms you should know are, logistic regression, SVM, KNN, Decision trees etc.
2.) Unsupervised Learning

 * Clustering :— Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. It can be defined as ""A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. Clustering algorithms are DBSCAN, K-means, mean-shift etc.
 * Association :— Association rule learning is a type of unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another data item and maps accordingly so that it can be more profitable. It tries to find some interesting relations or associations among the variables of dataset. It is based on different rules to discover the interesting relations between variables in the database. Recommendation System is one of the example of association.
But believe me, when it comes to learning all these topics and algorithms, it is not a piece of cake. It requires a proper guidance & content to go through it. Therefore I am recommending you a course that personally helped me a lot to get all these concepts thoroughly. Well, the course is ""Machine learning course"" by [code ]Coding Ninjas[/code]. The course is taught by highly educated instructors & also provides teaching assistants those make sure that you doubt doesn't become a hurdle in your learning. Also the the course has some amazing projects that helped me to enhance my resume. Some other features of the course are that :—

1. The course is entirely built with a mindset of training a beginner to an expert in machine learning.
2. The course not only focusses on the Coding aspect of Machine Learning, but also covers theoretical concepts of Machine Learning concepts like Regression, Classifiers and Decision Trees.
3. Other than this there are almost 10 Projects that are embedded in the curriculum that that will not only help you to gain more understanding of the concepts but will also increase your problem solving abilities. The projects included are:
4. 
1. Case Study - Indian Startups
2. Zomato API
3. Web Scraping : InstaBot
4. Decision Tree Implementation
5. Text Classification
6. Cifar10
7. Twitter Sentiment Analysis
8. Image caption generator
9. Music Note Generation

5. The course also contains data structures and algorithms which will help you alot to crack coding interviews.
At the end, I will suggest you to atleast take a free trial of the course. And if you like the course, then purchase it.

Well, That's all from my side. I hope i resolved your doubt. Please feel free to reach through comments in case of any other doubt. I will be happy to assist.

Happy Learning !!",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=317429201,2021-10-31T18:36:40.439376+00:00,2021-10-31T18:49:06.609746+00:00,5,Lov Lamba,https://www.quora.com/profile/Lov-Lamba-1
Is machine learning really difficult?,"No. I wrote my first ML program waaay back in 1982, before there was Internet, Google, GPU computing, laptops, cellphones, digital cameras, desktop PCs, heck before there was almost anything remotely resembling what you see in the tech world around you today.

How did I even discover the existence of such a field? Back then, to educate oneself, you read books. Of course, you had to either go to a library, or in my case, a quaint event called a book fair. I attended a large book fair in New Delhi, India’s capital, and picked up this 800 page tome, a fairly massive affair. Why, I don’t know. After all, I was at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, studying to become an electrical engineer.

Hofstadter’s first book, and in my opinion, still his best, was an utter revelation to me. It opened up a whole new world of imagination of what deep links there are between art, music and abstract math, realized by the three central characters — Johann Sebastian Bach, Maurice Escher, Kurt Gödel — and computing, including of course AI and ML.

The book featured an intriguing set of visual puzzles from a Russian researcher named Bongard, where the task is to discover a rule that separates the six figures on the left from those on the right. This is an elementary problem in ML called classification. It’s analogous to distinguishing email from spam or deciding if an image contains a face. As humans, we classify sensory stimuli billions of times through our lives, and our very survival depends on it. As you cross the road, is the object approaching you a person or a Fedex truck? Get the answer wrong and your life may indeed be over. Not surprisingly, we solve such problems amazingly well.

I’ll leave you to work this one out, but with absolutely no training in this field, I nonetheless decided to foolishly make this the core of my Masters thesis project. Somehow I plodded through and worked out a solution, however naively it seems in retrospect. That experience made me realize that AI and ML was my life’s goal, and I decided to come to the United States in 1983, where I was incredibly fortunate to work with this brilliant Stanford educated researcher, Thomas Mitchell, now the Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

From Tom, I learned the most important lesson of all, which no book can teach you. Research is *fun*. He simply embodied the spirit of a researcher who bubbled with enthusiasm for the field of ML. He worked harder than anyone I had met, yet seemed to be having a ball. That lesson made a huge imprint on me and stayed with me ever since.

After getting my PhD, I joined IBM Watson Research in New York in late 1989, where they couldn’t figure out what to do with an ML researcher. So they threw me into a newly formed robotics group, even though I had absolutely no background in this field. I had never ever programmed a robot. Amazingly enough, I seemed to thrive in this somewhat challenging situation, and ended up writing some of my most highly cited papers, exploring how robots can acquire new behaviors using the newly emerging field of reinforcement learning. I also published in 1993 perhaps the first book on robot learning, which featured research from all over the world in this new area of AI. Despite having no background in robotics, I still managed to make a name for myself.

Many years later, I was elected a Fellow of AAAI, the leading international professional society for AI researchers. Each year, a small handful of researchers are selected and the competition is fierce. This year’s AAAI Fellows include some of the founders of the deep learning revolution: Yoshua Bengio, and Yann Le Cun.

The list of AAAI Fellows include some of the most amazing researchers in AI and ML, and I’m humbled to be listed in such distinguished company. None of this would have happened if back in 1982, I thought doing ML with no formal training in this field, with primitive computing, or doing robot learning at IBM in 1990 with no training in robotics, was “difficult”.

For those aspiring young researchers reading this on Quora, the best advice I can give you is that nothing is “difficult” if you set yourself the challenge of working on it. Above all, remember: research is fun! It’s an exploration into the unknown.

For many years, from 2001–2018, I was privileged to co-direct the Autonomous Learning Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, with one of reinforcement learning’s true pioneers, Andrew Barto. Andy and his former PhD student, Rich Sutton, helped establish the modern field of RL, the area that gave rise to Deep Mind and Alpha Go Zero. Andy and Rich embodied the true spirit of researchers having fun and working with them was the best professional experience of my career.

PhD students at the lab hung up a sign on the main door that was a quote from one of the most distinguished scientists of all time, Albert Einstein.

That sums it all. Research doesn’t need expertise. Einstein in fact hated textbook knowledge. Above all, he prized imagination, the ability to dream. If you want to make your children smart, he told parents, teach them fairy stories.

As we battle the latest pandemic, the Wuhan coronavirus, the biggest weapon at our disposal is our ability to sequence its genome. The biggest breakthrough in biology of the 20th century came from Watson and Crick, two brash biologists who upturned the world of biology by having fun! Watson went on to write a highly popular account of their discovery called the Double Helix. In it he tells the story of how they scandalized established researchers, like Oswald Avery of Columbia University, when he realized they didn’t know elementary biochemistry. Yet, by playing with 3D models and in effect stealing from Rosalind Franklin’s carefully gathered data sets, they cracked the secret of life. They were simply having fun!

So, again, my answer is, no, ML is not difficult. It is fun!",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=194849445,2020-01-29T01:15:51.169192+00:00,2020-11-28T16:39:32.936709+00:00,1174,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
Can I learn machine learning in 1 week?,"Generally, the answer to any question of the form “Can I learn X (some topic) with Y effort (time duration)” hinges on what you mean by “learn”. Therein lies the rub, as the saying goes. Certainly, by some definitions of the term “learn”, you can certainly “learn” ML in a week, in fact you can learn something about ML in a day! Heck, you can learn something about ML in an hour!!

For example, I just read a fascinating article on the fierce Komodo dragons, which are the largest predatory lizards on the planet. They can grow up to hundreds of pounds, and have incredibly sharp teeth. But, that’s not the scary part. The scary part is that a single (teensy weensy) bite from a Komodo is enough to bring down a fully grown bison, because evolution has engineered in the Komodo dragon a powerful set of anticoagulants. Once bitten, however minor the bite, the prey will essentially bleed out to death.

So, how did the Komodo dragon develop this fierce capability, along with the ability to hunt its prey over many miles of distance due to a phenomenal sense of smell. Groundbreaking research into their genetics has revealed a large set of mutations in about 200 of their 18000 genes, including changes to the mitochondria, which enables them to chase down their prey at terrifying speeds once they get close. I learned all this in about 20 minutes of reading the following NY Times article this afternoon:

Genome Study Reveals Clues to Komodo Dragon’s Unique Abilities [ https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/science/komodo-dragon-genome.html?action=click&module=Discovery&pgtype=Homepage ]

Now, this little bit of reading does not, of course, make me a world’s expert on Komodo dragons, any more than your spending a week learning ML will qualify you to do more than engage in polite after dinner conversation on how ML is used in certain applications (e.g., self-driving cars). But, if all you are after is gaining enough competency to engage in a little bit of chit chat about a hot technology, a week is plenty.

For example, block chain is currently another hot technology, and all my knowledge of block chain comes from reading snippets here and there, probably all told less than a week’s worth of time. Yes, I know a smattering of ideas related to block chain (e.g., it uses a distributed ledger), but other than nodding my head during a technical presentation on block chain, I can’t say I have any deep understanding of the core ideas.

In terms of machine learning, I have been studying it for almost 40 years! I wrote my first ML program in 1982, as a young student fascinated by this amazing futuristic software concept, all but sure that, while it made me stay up night after night writing my first ML program in Lisp on a huge clunky Digital Equipment Corporation DEC-10 computer in a cavernous computer room at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, it would largely be a harmless source of fun, and I’d have to get serious employment doing something far more boring, but much more useful. Little did I realize then that I would end up spending my whole professional life in the field, and that it would lead to being *very* well compensated.

So, after almost 40 years, have I “learned” ML finally? Alas, no. I still feel like I have much more to learn, and that this is a field that has infinite depth. However, the field has progressed so much in the 37 years I have spent studying it (my first professional ML meeting in 1985 had 50 attendees, and recent NeurIPS conferences have had more than 10,000 participants!) that I am slowly but surely shifting my focus to other topics in AI that are equally important, but far less well understood.

Machine learning is all about gaining insights from data, from history, from the past, and is incredibly useful if the future looks like the past. That works in a lot of practical problems, and over a reasonably short duration (e.g, a few seconds to a few years). It works much less well over a long duration, and it certainly does not work at all well in cases when there is no data about the phenomena you want to reason about.

You may ask: how can we possibly think about problems for which we have *no* data? In fact, that is *exactly* what distinguishes human imagination and creativity from machine learning. Every major advance in science and technology, from painting and arts, from music to poetry and beyond, is based not on data science by itself, but by imagining a future that does not exist.

Einstein was a great believer in imagination, and he considered it far more important than knowledge (which he said limits you to what we know today). He asked an almost childlike question: “If I travel at the speed of light, and hold out in front of me a mirror, will I see my reflection?”. What a beautiful example of imagination! This is not a data science experiment, and chances are, we cannot ever conduct such an experiment (not literally anyway). But it didn’t stop Einstein from using this “gedankenexperiment”, and many others like it, to develop his special, and later general, theories of relativity.

So, I am now focusing on the regime where data is of not much help (like if Tesla succeeded in selling a million self-driving cars in the Bay Area, and they are all running autonomously, how will that impact traffic?). My current focus is on understanding this mysterious thing called imagination, which to me is one of the most elegant things that humans do, and which runs their lives from early childhood to death. Yet, we understand it very poorly, and to me, at present, this is far more fascinating a topic than machine learning. The latter I leave to the tens of thousands who flock to meetings like NeurIPS.

Like the immortal biography of Richard Feynman by Jagdish Mehra, I choose “to hear the beat of a different drum”. I did that in 1982, when I started to study ML when almost no one in India was interested in this field, in 1990 when I started to develop a framework for robot learning around reinforcement learning, when both fields were in their infancy, and now I choose to study imagination, a topic that barely cites any mention in the AI/ML literature.

Each of you gets to decide what you spend your time learning — whether it is learning about Komodo dragons, block chain technology, or ML — and you spend 40 years or a week or an hour, it’s time well spent. You’ve learned something new, and you’re more well educated. Ultimately, being educated about some important topic, no matter how poorly, is what will save humanity.

If I had to pick one topic that I would urge all of you to understand, particularly if you are young, it is climate change. It will not affect me much, since I expect that by 2050, when the dire effects of climate change start to wreak havoc, I will have moved on to the next phase of my existence! But, for those of you in your 20’s, you will be entering the same age that I am today, and your lives will be ruled by the terrifying economic and social and political consequences of climate change. And if there is anything we can do about it, at this penultimate hour, it will only come about if we are prepared to educate ourselves about it with an open mind.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=160316067,2019-08-12T01:30:22.790716+00:00,,171,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"We'd ask the following types/examples of questions, not all of which are considered pass/fail, but do give us a reasonable comprehensive picture of the candidate's depth in this area.

In general, pick one or two (that the candidate is good at) and keep going deeper and deeper, rather than go horizontally through some checklist. It is far more indicative of depth.

General mastery: when you really understand something (e.g., you've gone through the cycle of learning-doing-teaching-doing), you can express seemingly complex concepts in simple ways. Or you develop insightful views on things at a broader level and can explain it to others. E.g.,:
1. Discuss your views on the relationship between machine learning and statistics.

2. Talk about how Deep Learning (or XYZ method) fits (or not?) within the field.

3. Isn't it all just curve fitting? Talk about that.

4. How are kernel methods different?

5. Why do we need/want the bias term?

6. Why do we call it GLM when it's clearly non-linear? (somewhat tricky question, to be asked somewhat humorously---but extremely revealing.)

7. How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms? What are Fourier transforms, for that matter?

8. Etc.


ML skills specific: E.g.,
1. Pick an algorithm you like and walk me through the math and then the implementation of it, in pseudo-code.
2. OK now let's pick another one, maybe more advanced.
3. Discuss the meaning of the ROC curve, and write pseudo-code to generate the data for such a curve.
4. Discuss how you go about feature engineering (look for both intuition and specific evaluation techniques).
5. Etc.

Distributed systems (our needs): E.g.,
1. Discuss MapReduce (or your favorite parallelization abstraction). Why is MapReduce referred to as a ""shared-nothing"" architecture (clearly the nodes have to share something, no?) What are the advantages/disadvantages of ""shared-nothing""?
2. Pick an algorithm. Write the pseudo-code for its parallel version.
3. What are the trade-offs between closed-form and iterative implementations of an algorithm, in the context of distributed systems?
4. Etc.

Other (hands-on experience, past accomplishments, etc.):
1. Do you have experience with R (or Weka, Scikit-learn, SAS, Spark, etc.)? Tell me what you've done with that. Write some example data pipelines in that environment.
2. Tell me about a time when you ... { worked on a project involving ML ; optimized an algorithm for performance/accuracy/etc. }
3. Estimate the amount of time in your past project spent on each segment of your data mining/machine learning work.
4. Etc.

What are the questions that I should ask myself after learning a machine learning algorithm?,"What I care to have in my memory about an algorithm is in which tasks can I use it and the intuition on how the algorithm trains the model. Details beyond that I keep in notes on Evernote.

I don’t feel any obligation in knowing everything.

Should a machine learning beginner go straight for deep learning?,"Today, everybody wants to be a Deep Learning expert. But if you asked this question 15 years ago, you probably would have asked about Support Vector Machines because that was the hot new thing in machine learning back then. If this was 10 years ago, then you would have asked about ensemble methods because Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees were all the rage. And 10 years from now, Deep Learning's popularity will probably be overtaken by some newer technique, and newbies on Quora will ask if it's best to go straight into that. See a pattern here?

You never know what will be the next trendy thing and don't want to risk getting pigeonholed into an area that was once hot but later becomes outdated. To avoid that fate, you should become a well-rounded machine learning expert rather than a Deep Learning expert.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=17907487,2015-12-18T20:14:32.801742+00:00,2016-08-31T11:53:21.121444+00:00,133,Li Yang,https://www.quora.com/profile/Li-Yang-113
What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"Rather than just share a comprehensive list of questions, I thought I could add value by talking about this from a different angle.

I’ve realized that many people, when giving advice on ML interview prep, miss one of the most crucial aspects of the process: that there are actually two “parts” to the interview, representing two different types of questions you might be asked.

1. Questions about your specific knowledge of ML theory. Importantly, these are generally questions that have a particular correct answer that the interviewer is looking for. You might be asked about things like bias and variance, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, Bayes’ Theorem and how to use it, how to avoid overfitting models, and other such questions.

Of course, the above is critical. If you don’t understand the core concepts of Machine Learning, it will be tough for you to ever become an outstanding machine learning engineer, and a major company wouldn’t take a risk on hiring you - regardless of how charming your smile is.

If you’re interested, here’s a relevant list of practice questions [ https://www.educative.io/blog/top-machine-learning-interview-questions ].

However, I argue that candidates spend way too much time preparing for the above, and not enough on the second category of ML interview questions:

2. Machine Learning system design questions. These are open-ended questions that don’t have a particular correct answer you can quote. Instead, you will be asked to think about, make decisions, and explain your logic in designing a complex system.

Some examples of such questions include:

 * Design a search ranking system for a search engine
 * Design a recommendation system for a Netflix-like platform
 * Design a Twitter-like feed system that shows people the most relevant Tweets to them
 * Design an ad prediction system to show relevant ads to users
As you can see, questions like these require you to integrate your knowledge of ML theory with the ability to “zoom out” and think about real-world ML problems at a high level. More so than your specific solutions, interviewers are interested in hearing about how you approach such problems. What factors do you consider? What tradeoffs do you make? Why?

Your performance on questions like these makes a huge difference on not just your hire/no hire decision, but also your hiring level, which is often just as important and can make a huge difference on your salary.

There aren’t too many resources out there that will help you prepare for ML system design questions. The best one for it is Grokking the Machine Learning Interview [ https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-machine-learning-interview ], which focuses on the system design aspect of ML in depth.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=246647520,2020-10-29T00:43:43.510738+00:00,,172,Fahim ul Haq,https://www.quora.com/profile/Fahim-ul-Haq
Should a machine learning beginner go straight for deep learning?,"If he is a beginner, I would say no. It takes a while to understand the following aspects in details before one applies it in deep learning.

1. Regularization.
2. Underfitting and Overfitting and how to identify them
3. Various cost functions
4. A thorough understanding of stochastic gradient descent
5. Hyper parameter tuning
6. Cross validation techniques

 The above ones are the most important. A basic understanding of how neural networks work is enough to get into deep learning. 

It may be temtpting to say that exploring deep learning implicitly covers the above but the other details in deep learning algorithms may distract the mind. It is worth spending a month thoroughly understanding the above as part of other algorithms such as linear regression and then coming into deep learning.

That's how it worked great for me.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=13702336,2015-07-01T16:07:22.187361+00:00,,143,Abhishek Shivkumar,https://www.quora.com/profile/Abhishek-Shivkumar
What are the questions that I should ask myself after learning a machine learning algorithm?,"I think it’s not about a particular algorithm, but more about how you organize everything in your brain. If you have a “landscape” or “categorization” of a bunch of classic algorithms, when a new algorithm comes in, all you need to remember is where should the algorithm be placed in the landscape.

A few important criterions are:

 * linear / nonlinear
 * continuous features / discrete features / both
 * regression / classification
 * parametric / non-parametric
 * generative / discriminative
 * convex / non-convex
 * independent samples / correlated samples
 * ensembled / not ensembled
 * shallow / deep
It is however, quite difficult to categorize every possible algorithm in a principled way. Kevin Murphy’s book is my go-to reference, which on the top level, categorized most algorithms from a probabilistic point of view.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=25335760,2016-07-18T22:49:44.012722+00:00,,1,Shuyang Sheng,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shuyang-Sheng
How much should I go into mathematical concepts in machine learning?,"I will try to keep this as concise as possible.

Edit: Somebody merged the original question to this question, so the premise becomes irrelevant.

To become a full stack AI/ML engineer, it is imperative that you have a complete grasp of the mathematical foundations of ML so that you can build upon concepts easily. The basic mathematical skills required are Linear Algebra, Matrix Algebra, Probability and some basic Calculus.

Linear Algebra

The best source to study Linear Algebra is Prof. Gilbert Strang’s Linear Algebra book/course. Video Lectures | Linear Algebra | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/ ] (MIT OCW). There are 34 lectures and believe me, they are completely worth it as after completing this, linear algebra should not pose any more problems for you. Solve some exercises/exams if you want to achieve mastery (recommended).

Matrix Algebra

Matrix algebra is an essential component of deep learning. I personally recommend this (Matrix Cookbook by Kaare Brandt Petersen & Michael Syskind Pedersen): http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf (PDF). There are 66 pages of pure matrix operations and this is the absolute “go-to” in case you are stuck trying to understand certain matrix manipulations that a researcher might have done.

Probability & Statistics

Understanding probability is a very important aspect of understanding ML. Some of the key probability concepts that you must be aware of include Bayes’ Theorem, distributions, MLE, regression, inference and so on. The best resource for this is Think Stats (Exploratory Data Analysis in Python) by Allen Downey: http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf (PDF). This absolute gem of a book is 264 pages long and covers all the aspects of probability and statistics that you need to understand with relevant Python code.

Optimization

The go-to book for Convex Optimization is Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe: https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf (PDF). This is a 730 page book and you need not read it all in one go. Choose the concept which you need to learn depending on your requirements and interest and read that part. It is complete and extremely well written. This book is free as part of the CVX 101 MOOC on EdX.

This 263 page book on metaheuristics, Essentials of Metaheuristics by Sean Luke (http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf (PDF)) talks about gradient based optimization, policy optimization etc. and it is well written. One can choose to go through this also if interested.

Data science concepts are covered in the above topics. Other topics can be learnt by googling for sources easily as and when you encounter them. But complete understanding of the above should suffice for 95% of all scenarios.


Achieving mastery of the above topics will surely make you a mathematically strong AI/ML engineer. Now that you have built the foundation, start dipping your feet into research papers. They are absolutely essential as these clearly show the standards of AI researchers/engineers. Firstly, find out the famous papers of AI like RNN, LSTM, SVM etc. and go through the technical content.

Can you understand the jargon?

Can you understand the mathematics?

Can you implement the mathematics in code now without the help of overly sufficient libraries?

These are the key questions to be answered. Once you can answer “Yes/Mostly Yes” to these 3 questions, you are good to go.

After trying to read these papers dealing with the most popular concepts, try to read the not-so-famous papers. arXiv is a great site with hundreds of preprints being published everyday by top researchers and reading the papers from here is like drinking straight out of the fire-hose. Try to choose a paper which looks fairly well written and the abstract seems interesting. Then, read that paper and try to answer those 3 questions again. The same can be done with papers of top AI conferences like NIPS, AAAI, AAMAS, IJCAI, ICML etc. You may not be able to fully implement the papers due to data constraints and other issues, but if you are able to understand even 60% of the mathematical reasoning, then I can safely say you have completed your training.

Do not concentrate on learning more and more “packages”. Concentrate on the concept. While implementing, you will automatically see that you require “this” package and then you will automatically learn to use it. Learning the various commands of random packages won’t help. If you start implementing and writing codes to solve problems or simulate results from a paper, you will automatically learn about packages and use them appropriately; they’ll be the least of your concerns. This is the correct way to maintain “balance” between math and coding. You can also participate in competitions (e.g. Kaggle or conference competitions) to improve speed, development and processing skills if you feel the need to do so.

How do I learn mathematics for machine learning?,"Great question! How indeed does one prepare oneself for a (research or otherwise) career in machine learning, in particular in terms of familiarizing oneself with the underlying mathematics? I’m going to resist the temptation of trotting out some standard books, and instead, focus on giving broad advice.

There’s some bad news on this front, and it’s best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible. Having spent 35+ years studying machine learning, let me put this in the most direct way possible: no matter how much time and effort you devote to it, you can never know enough math to read through all the ML literature. Different parts of ML use a variety of esoteric math. There’s just no way one person can know all of this math, so it’s good to be forewarned.

OK, with that out of the way, how does one prepare oneself? Think of the process analogous to conditioning your mind and body to run a marathon. It’s a gradual process, of improving your fitness, your ability to run for longer and longer distances, your breathing technique, your mental focus, and dozens of other dimensions. Working in ML is not like running a 100 meter sprint, where the race is pretty much over in a single breath. It’s much more of an endurance sport, where you have to constantly work at it to remain in shape, and there’s no point at which you can relax and say: OK, I know it all! Because no one does!

An example from my recent work will clarify the issues involved. One of the major challenges in machine learning is that there’s never enough training data to tackle every ML problem that presents itself. Humans are especially adept in solving this challenge. I can get on a flight from San Francisco and within a few short hours find myself in a dizzying diversity of new environments, from the glitzy subways of Tokyo and the bleak winter in Scandinavia to an arid savannah in Africa, or a swampy rainforest in Brazil. There’s no way I can ever hope to collect training samples from every possible environment that I can encounter in life. So, what do we do? We transfer our learned knowledge from places we’ve been — so, having taken the BART subway in San Francisco, and subways in New York and London, I can try to handle the complexity of the subway in Tokyo by drawing upon my previous experience. Of course, it doesn’t quite match — the language is completely different, the tone and texture of the visual experience is completely different (attendants in gloved hands show you the way in Tokyo — no such luxury is available in the US!). Yet, we somehow manage, and plod our way through new experiences. We even cherish the prospect of finding ourselves in some alien new culture, where we don’t speak the language and can’t ask for directions. It opens up our mind to new horizons, all part of the charm of travel.

So, what’s the mathematics involved in implementing a transfer learning algorithm? It varies a lot depending on what type of approach you investigate. Let’s review some approaches from computer vision over the past few years. One class of approaches are so-called subspace methods, where the training data from a collection of images in the “source” domain (which conveniently has labels given to us) is to be compared with a collection of unlabeled images from a “target” domain (e.g., “source” → NY subway, “target” → Tokyo subway).

One can take a collection of images of size NxN and using a variety of different methods find the smallest subspace that the source images lie in (treating each image as a vector in N^2 dimensions). Now, to understand this body of work, you obviously need to know some linear algebra. So, if you don’t understand linear algebra, or you took a class way back when and forgot it all, it’s time to refresh your memory or learn anew. Fortunately, there are excellent textbooks (Strang is usually a good place to start) and also something like MATLAB will let you explore linear algebraic ML methods without having to implement things like eigenvalue or singular value decomposition. As I usually told my students, keep the motto “eigen do it if I try” in mind. Persevere, and keep the focus on why you are learning this math. Because it is important and essential to understand much of modern ML.

OK, great, you’ve managed to learn some linear algebra. Are you done? Ummm, not quite. So, back to our transfer learning example. You construct a source subspace from the source images, and a target subspace from the target images. Umm, how does one do that. OK, you can use a garden variety dimensionality reduction method like principal components analysis (PCA), which just computes the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the source and target images. This is one subroutine call in MATLAB. But, PCA is 100 years old. How about something new and cool, like a ooh la la subspace tracking method like GOUDA, which uses the fancier math of Lie groups. Oops, now you need to learn some group theory, the mathematics of symmetry. As it turns out, matrices of certain types, like all invertible matrices, or all positive definite matrices, are not just linear algebraic objects, they are also of interest in group theory, a particularly important subfield of which is Lie groups (Lie → “Lee”).

OK, great, you have a smattering of knowledge of group theory and Lie groups. Are you done? Hmmm…actually not, because it turns out Lie groups are not just groups, but they are also continuous manifolds. What in the blazes is a “manifold”? If you google this, you are likely to encounter web pages describing engine parts! No, a manifold is something entirely different in machine learning, where it means a non-Euclidean space that has curvature. It turns out the set of all probability distributions (e.g., 1 dimensional Gaussians with a scalar variance dimension and a scalar mean dimension) are not Euclidean, but rather, describe a curved space. So, the set of all positive definite matrices form a Lie group, with a certain curvature. What this implies is that obvious operations like taking the average have to done with considerable care. So, off you go, learning all there is to know about manifolds, Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, exp and log mappings, etc. Oh, what fun!

Getting back to our transfer learning method, if you compute the source covariance matrix C_s and the target covariance matrix C_t, then there is a simple method called CORAL (for correlational alignment) that figures out how to transform C_s into C_t using some invertible mapping A. CORAL is popular as a transfer learning method in computer vision. But, CORAL does not actually use the knowledge that the space of positive definite matrices (or covariance matrices) forms a manifold. In fact, it forms something called a cone in convex analysis. If you subtract one covariance matrix from another, the result is not a covariance matrix. So, they do not form a vector space, but rather something else entirely. Oops, it turns out the study of cones is important in convex analysis, so there you go again, you need to learn about convex sets and functions, projections onto convex sets, etc. The dividing line between tractable and intractable optimization is not linear vs. nonlinear, but rather, convex vs. non-convex.

I hope the pattern is becoming clear. Like one of those legendary Russian dolls, where each time you open one, you find it is not the end, but there’s another one inside it, so it is with learning math in machine learning. Each time you learn a bit of math, you find it opens the door to an entirely new field of math, which you need to know something about as well. For my most recent paper, I had to digest a whole book devoted entirely to the topic of positive definite matrices (it’s like the old joke, where the deeper you go, the more you know about a specialized topic, until you know everything about —- nothing!).

Any given problem in machine learning, like transfer learning, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, as a manifold learning problem, as a multivariate statistical estimation problem, as a nonlinear gradient based deep learning problem, etc. etc. Each of these requires learning a bit about the underlying math involved.

If you feel discouraged, and feel like tearing your hair out at this point, I sympathize with you. But, on the other hand, you can look on the positive side, and realize that in terms of our analogy of running a marathon, you are steadily becoming better at running the long race, building your mathematical muscle as you go along, and gradually things start falling into place. Things start to make sense, and different subfields start connecting with each other. Something strange happens. You start liking it! Of course, there’s a drawback. Someone who doesn't understand any of the math you get good at using asks you to explain your work, and you realize that it’s impossible to do that without writing equations.

Most researchers find their comfort zone and try to stay within it, since otherwise, it takes a great deal of time and effort to master the dozens of mathematical subfields that modern ML uses. But, this strategy eventually fails, and one is always forced to get outside one’s comfort zone and learn some new math, since otherwise, a whole area of the field becomes alien to you.

Fortunately, the human brain is an amazing instrument, and provides decades and decades of trouble-free operation, allowing us to continually learn over 40,50, 60, years or more. How precisely it does that without zeroing out all prior learning is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science!",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=72758478,2018-02-10T22:34:01.177380+00:00,2018-02-13T10:03:28.965016+00:00,1302,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6

What is machine learning in layman's terms?,"Well, the answer given by Fabien seems specific and technical.

I'll try to draw an analogy with life examples. Of course, I am not going to cover all topics, but some popular terms you may have heard in ML are here.

Machine Learning is about making decision based on trial and error and is a more application oriented version of statistics. The basic idea is to make decisions based on certain amount of information you have. 

Classification based on data
1. You have seen people screw up their lives by smoking. You make the decision that neither you nor your kids will ever smoke because you learnt in life that smoking kills.

2. You have observed that fat people tend to have heart diseases. You make the decision that you will try to remain thin, else you'll suffer from heart diseases.

Mathematically, you have observed a ton of data, and come up with a rule for classification. You have decided that a certain characteristic means class A, else class B.


Gradient Descent
1. When you touch a hot plate, you get hurt, you pull back your hand. You are unlikely to touch a hot plate again on purpose. Or you use mittens next time.

2. While throwing darts at a target, you don't get it right at the first shot. You move your aim and change the force, which makes you think that you'll get closer to the bulls eye. You miss again, you calculate again, and change your tactics again, till you get very close or you hit the bulls eye (or you get bored after wasting a ton of time ad quit)
Mathematically, you are doing trial and error. You look at a random attempt, calculate the error made. Then you calculate the change in your technique which you expect will lead to a better result. Then you try out the new technique. 


Online Learning
1. You play black jack. Based on the sequence of cards you see, you make a quick decision whether to hit or to stay
2. You are a trader, you are getting sequential data of a stock, you decide when to buy and sell.
Mathematically, you are now faced with the task of making quick decisions. Based on previous information you have and looking at what happens, you decide quickly. For example, you have kept count of cards in Black Jack, and you'll know when you want to raise the stakes if the count is high.

Transfer Learning
1. Your mom taught you how to choose oranges. She sends you to the grocery to buy apples. Though you don't know how to, you can use some common sense to do this.
2. You know how to play tennis, shouldn't take long to pick squash.
This is essentially what the HR of companies term as transferable skills.

Regression
1. You get the data for house price vs area of house. You plot this on a graph. You see that it is almost a straight line. You approximately draw the straight line, and now you think you cna predict the price of the house if someone tells you the area.
Machines do it in a more mathematical and formal way.


Now replace yourself with a machine, and give the machine some steps to follow so that it can learn the same things like you. A machine lacks the thinking power to manage an unexpected scenario, but it doesn't make mistakes on the basis of what it has learnt (and is faster than you). So now, the machine is learning from its environment, and we call it Machine Learning.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=2601388,2013-05-30T17:08:53.375956+00:00,2013-05-31T03:31:30.675015+00:00,205,Anonymous,
How does a total beginner start to learn machine learning if they have some knowledge of programming languages?,"Awesome questions! Machine learning is a great field to get into; not only is it highly sought after by employers, it also helps you understand the world in a new way.

Most machine learning algorithms are based heavily in math, and are made possible by programming. Here are the basic things I would suggest picking up as you tackle machine learning:

1. Matrix Algebra: Matrix algebra is really important when you start working with large amounts of data; here’s a good online matrix algebra class from MIT: Linear Algebra [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/ ]
2. Statistics: It’s been argued that machine learning is really just computer aided statistics. I’m not sure if I totally agree with that, but having a basis in statistics will help you wrap your head around a lot of the simpler learning algorithms (i.e. regression). I haven’t taken this course specifically, but I’ve heard good things about Udacity’s statistics offering: Elementary Statistics Course Online [ https://www.udacity.com/course/statistics--st095 ]
3. Calculus: I know, now it sounds like I’m just listing off every math class I know—like I said, machine learning is math-heavy. You don’t need that much calculus, but having a basic grasp of what a derivative is will be really helpful. This page is pretty simple, but if you can get through it and fell like you understand what’s going on, you’re in good shape (at least to start): The Definition of the Derivative [ http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/diff/der00/der00.html ]
4. Programming: Of course you’ll have to program in order to actually implement learning algorithms, and it’s good to know a general purpose programming language. You said you have experience with Java and Python and those are great. If you didn’t I would recommend picking up Python through CodeCademy: Python [ https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python ]
5. MatLab: It’s important to know how to program in general, but it’s also really helpful to be familiar with MatLab; you can effectively study machine learning in another language (i.e. Python) but so many of the resources for beginners use MatLab. If you are in college you can probably get MatLab for free through your institution. If not, I would suggest trying out Octave; it’s fairly similar to MatLab, and its free.
6. Basic Learning Algorithms: Finally to the fun stuff. To get a feel for the basics I would strongly suggest you check out Andrew Ng’s Coursera course on machine learning. It’s well made, and very accessible. In it he draws on all the things in this list; although he briefly introduces each of these subjects, it’ll be a lot easier if you have a foundation in all of them before tackling machine learning: Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/ ]
If you can make your way through this list, by the end you should at least be familiar with the field of machine learning, and be prepared to figure out what you want to learn next. Good luck!",https://www.quora.com/What-are-machine-learning-questions-for-beginners?top_ans=28288622,2016-09-24T14:12:19.336898+00:00,,256,William Lifferth,https://www.quora.com/profile/William-Lifferth

So, while modeling is part of your job, it’s only a small part. Sure, it’s the fun part but it’s not what you’ll be doing most of the time. Read this [ https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-scams-in-the-data-science-field-industry/answer/Mike-West-99 ].

Most of the time you’ll be massaging data into a shape the model can attain the best performance from… and… that sh!t isn’t so fun.

So, while you learning modeling focus on what you’ll need in the real world, and the number 1 thing you’ll need in the real world is heavy data skills.

If you have those, then on to modeling. If you don’t, then I’d highly recommend you get those first.

If you aren’t in some kind of job working with SQL then that’s probably your best route to becoming a machine learning engineer.

For most of us, NO SQL = NO JOB.

What are some basic projects in machine learning?,"The best way to learn Machine Learning, or for that matter any skill, is to take-up projects. Projects help you get a realistic perspective of how things work at the ground level. Here are some interesting project ideas in Machine Learning which you may want to work on in order to build a great resume:

 * Handwritten Digit Recognition: this is the standard project that everyone takes-up and you should also do it. The project is about one of the simplest Machine Learning datasets - “the MNIST dataset [ http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ ]” which contains a set of handwritten images containing numbers from 0 to 9 and you are asked to train a Machine Learning algorithm that can correctly identify the digits. By taking up this project, you will learn a lot of aspects of Machine Learning - loading and cleaning data, data preprocessing, applying various ML algorithms on a given set of data, finding the right metrics to measure the algorithm performance, etc.
 * House Price Prediction: House Price Prediction problem [ https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data ] is another interesting problem that is focused more on applying Regression techniques. Linear Regression is a simple, yet powerful Machine Learning algorithm and knowing how to apply it would be extremely useful to solve a variety of ML problems. Further, if you ever apply for an ML-related job, expect a question or 2 around Linear Regression.
 * COVID-19 Global Forecasting: this is a new problem that has emerged in the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Here is the dataset [ https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-1/data ]. The world is going through a crisis and any contribution from the Technology community in terms of predictions or helping the society would certainly be beneficial.
 * Iris Flower Prediction Dataset: The Iris dataset [ https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ] contains 3 flower classes of 50 rows each containing the data-points like the height of petal, the width of petal, the height of sepal, and width of the sepal. Based on these 4 parameters, you are supposed to classify a new data-point into one of the 3 flower classes.
 * Titanic Survival Prediction: This is the “Hello World! problem on Kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data ]”. The idea is to use parameters like age, gender, etc., and predict whether the person survived the Titanic crash or not. There are some interesting observations which you will learn about when you play with the Titanic Dataset.
Some other problems which are of interest to the world:

 * Sentiment Analysis: analyzing sentiment is an old problem. Every day new solutions to this problem are being created to solve this problem.
 * Credit Card Fraud Detection: a relatively well-known problem which is also quite important for the Industry. If you build something around it, Banks would love to purchase.
 * Insurance Fraudulent Claim Detection: Insurance companies spend millions of dollars every year to ensure that they don’t pay out a fraudulent claim. If someone solves this problem, they will make a ton of money.
I would recommend the below resources to learn ML and take-up projects:

 * Andrew Ng’s Course on Coursera [ https://bit.ly/1IXp8Lg ]
 * Udacity’s Machine Learning Course [ https://bit.ly/1JqYWZy ]
 * A Course on Learn Machine Learning by Building Projects [ https://bit.ly/2NVeC6b ]

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"We'd ask the following types/examples of questions, not all of which are considered pass/fail, but do give us a reasonable comprehensive picture of the candidate's depth in this area.

In general, pick one or two (that the candidate is good at) and keep going deeper and deeper, rather than go horizontally through some checklist. It is far more indicative of depth.

General mastery: when you really understand something (e.g., you've gone through the cycle of learning-doing-teaching-doing), you can express seemingly complex concepts in simple ways. Or you develop insightful views on things at a broader level and can explain it to others. E.g.,:
1. Discuss your views on the relationship between machine learning and statistics.

2. Talk about how Deep Learning (or XYZ method) fits (or not?) within the field.

3. Isn't it all just curve fitting? Talk about that.

4. How are kernel methods different?

5. Why do we need/want the bias term?

6. Why do we call it GLM when it's clearly non-linear? (somewhat tricky question, to be asked somewhat humorously---but extremely revealing.)

7. How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms? What are Fourier transforms, for that matter?

8. Etc.


ML skills specific: E.g.,
1. Pick an algorithm you like and walk me through the math and then the implementation of it, in pseudo-code.
2. OK now let's pick another one, maybe more advanced.
3. Discuss the meaning of the ROC curve, and write pseudo-code to generate the data for such a curve.
4. Discuss how you go about feature engineering (look for both intuition and specific evaluation techniques).
5. Etc.

Distributed systems (our needs): E.g.,
1. Discuss MapReduce (or your favorite parallelization abstraction). Why is MapReduce referred to as a ""shared-nothing"" architecture (clearly the nodes have to share something, no?) What are the advantages/disadvantages of ""shared-nothing""?
2. Pick an algorithm. Write the pseudo-code for its parallel version.
3. What are the trade-offs between closed-form and iterative implementations of an algorithm, in the context of distributed systems?
4. Etc.

Other (hands-on experience, past accomplishments, etc.):
1. Do you have experience with R (or Weka, Scikit-learn, SAS, Spark, etc.)? Tell me what you've done with that. Write some example data pipelines in that environment.
2. Tell me about a time when you ... { worked on a project involving ML ; optimized an algorithm for performance/accuracy/etc. }
3. Estimate the amount of time in your past project spent on each segment of your data mining/machine learning work.
4. Etc.

What are the most important artificial intelligence and machine learning interview questions?,"Artificial intelligence - or AI for short - is a technology that enables a computer to think or act in a more 'human' way. It does this by taking in information from its surroundings and deciding its response based on what it learns or senses.

In google, you can find good interview questions on many Edtech websites. Some of them are SkillPractical and etc..

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"Rather than just share a comprehensive list of questions, I thought I could add value by talking about this from a different angle.

I’ve realized that many people, when giving advice on ML interview prep, miss one of the most crucial aspects of the process: that there are actually two “parts” to the interview, representing two different types of questions you might be asked.

1. Questions about your specific knowledge of ML theory. Importantly, these are generally questions that have a particular correct answer that the interviewer is looking for. You might be asked about things like bias and variance, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, Bayes’ Theorem and how to use it, how to avoid overfitting models, and other such questions.

Of course, the above is critical. If you don’t understand the core concepts of Machine Learning, it will be tough for you to ever become an outstanding machine learning engineer, and a major company wouldn’t take a risk on hiring you - regardless of how charming your smile is.

If you’re interested, here’s a relevant list of practice questions [ https://www.educative.io/blog/top-machine-learning-interview-questions ].

However, I argue that candidates spend way too much time preparing for the above, and not enough on the second category of ML interview questions:

2. Machine Learning system design questions. These are open-ended questions that don’t have a particular correct answer you can quote. Instead, you will be asked to think about, make decisions, and explain your logic in designing a complex system.

Some examples of such questions include:

 * Design a search ranking system for a search engine
 * Design a recommendation system for a Netflix-like platform
 * Design a Twitter-like feed system that shows people the most relevant Tweets to them
 * Design an ad prediction system to show relevant ads to users
As you can see, questions like these require you to integrate your knowledge of ML theory with the ability to “zoom out” and think about real-world ML problems at a high level. More so than your specific solutions, interviewers are interested in hearing about how you approach such problems. What factors do you consider? What tradeoffs do you make? Why?

Your performance on questions like these makes a huge difference on not just your hire/no hire decision, but also your hiring level, which is often just as important and can make a huge difference on your salary.

There aren’t too many resources out there that will help you prepare for ML system design questions. The best one for it is Grokking the Machine Learning Interview [ https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-machine-learning-interview ], which focuses on the system design aspect of ML in depth.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-important-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-interview-questions?top_ans=246647520,2020-10-29T00:43:43.510738+00:00,,172,Fahim ul Haq,https://www.quora.com/profile/Fahim-ul-Haq
What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"When I am asked to interview people, I try to ascertain whether they know the math or not, and how to apply it  in a real world context.  I also look to see if they understand high performance computing and not just vanilla coding.  

I was asked to do this as a consultant, acting as a subject matter expert to help interview junior people for the firm.  

In our interviews, we asked a candidate to present some code they had written and to talk through it.   For an ML person, it would be some kind of ML code.

So, for example, I was involved with an interview with a Physics PhD from MIT discussing some NMF code he wrote in javascript.   The javascript was very good and he would be fine doing GUI work , Node.JS work, etc.  Certainly not something I could do.

Can he do Machine Learning.  Mind you, he has a PhD in a math heavy subject from one of the top 10 schools in the world.  So he should know the math.

I wanted to see if he knew how to get it to converge properly.  He did not.     He knew it was non-convex, but he did not know how to seed it, nor did he know about the convex variants. He tried to give me some nonsense about it being Bi-convex and whatnot. Dude, just use Kmeans++  to seed it.  Thats it.  Thats all you had to say.   This got totally past the VP of engineering and the CTO.    (They were just impressed that machine learning involved computing a first order derivative--something neither had since since college calculus)

So here, he knew some basic methods, but did not really know the most important ideas in the field, the important developments,  how to really code this.  It is clear that he had never done anything like this in his former work, nor did he really understand numerical methods.

This means that his solution would never work in production and -- more importantly -- that he would have no idea how to evaluate it or how to  fix it.  I see this a lot.   Also, he did not know the available open source codes, how they worked internally, and  which one to use,  or how to evaluate their performance.  For being a PhD from MIT, this was unacceptable to me.

There was also a code evaluation.  For me, one needs to know what runs fast and what does not. What good is a method that only runs on 300 data points?!     In this case, this interviewee had written his own javascript matrix library.  Did he know the BLAS libraries and how they work?  Or an alternative?     This is critical because you can't run anything in production if the code is too slow.   I see the same problem with most ruby coders--they just don't know numerical computing.    

I was not looking to evaluate 10,000 of complex code , whether he used Agile or Unit Testing.  Nor did I care about solving some high school brain teaser. I just wanted to see a small piece of code, with good engineering choices ,   a good understanding of the math, and how to make this solution work in a modest production environment . 

Id rather see old fashioned spectral clustering with a  Fortran library, which can scale, as opposed to trying to use a ""fancy"" method like NMF or LDA if you can not get it to work in production at scale.  (I'm not saying they don't scale--I am saying you better know how to get them to scale if you choose to use them)

In another interview, again a PhD (Ukrainian I think) who was very bright and had solved some good problems and had experience.  He was using an off-the-shelf SVM tool--a tool I know very well.   I asked a very basic question--how do you adjust the cost parameter for the SVM regularizer.   I rephrased the question a couple of different ways to give him a chance.    FAIL   In other words, did you read the documentation of the tool and did you understand which parameters to tweak and which ones to leave at the default settings  ( I kinda would like the person to have read the entire source code of the tool and know how it works. )   Again, this demonstrates a failure of the most basic mathematical concepts in ML -- Regularization-- and how they would apply in production.  Tuning this parameter can increase accuracy by %10-15 (or more).  Again, just simple stuff--but important stuff  This also shows a lack of attention to notice the important details of the work.  We actually offered this guy the job and he asked for a salary way out of the ballpark.  If he had not missed this critical question he might have been able to make the case for the salary.


Having shared all this, I would add that I think , for you, the market is very good and you will probably not encounter anything like this.  Why?  All you need to do is know more machine learning than the VP and the CTO--and here the bar is very low.   Everyone and his brother has a funding to do machine learning and they usually just need to solve one small problem and get the product out the door.  Most  (i.e 7/10 ) CTOs and VPs know absolutely nothing about even basic   machine learning  so they have no clue  even what to  ask. (Newton Raphson will blow them away, and they will think you are too expensive if you try compare stochastic gradient descent to interior point methods)  They got their start up funded based on the market potential of  the idea, and they are expected to hire people to invent their IP. 

  (Obviously if you are interviewing at Google or Lockheed Martin, disregard all of this and hire me once you get in)

P.S.   I was asked once by some VP/CTO evaluating me what the volume of a rectangular prism is.  AlI could think of was this old Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon  with the Prism on it 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon

I would never ask this kind of question but you will probably get asked many   puzzle questions like this if you are fresh out of school (or an old man like me I guess)  I seem to recall there are books and/or web sites with tons of these.

What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?,"I ask them to attack some common machine learning problems from the web domain that most machine learning researchers should have heard of.  It can be hard to bring people up to speed on your problem domain during a short interview, so I try to ask more familiar questions like ""How would you approach the Netflix Prize?"", ""How would you generate related searches on Bing?"", ""How would you suggest followers on Twitter?"".

I ask them to describe a ""Rolls Royce"" solution that you could implement in 3 months, then a version you could implement in 3 weeks, and another version you could implement if you only had 3 days.  This tells you how adaptable they are and if they can come up with pragmatic approaches.

Most of the things we build need to scale, so I probe them about how their approach would work on large amounts of data.  MapReduce based solutions are nice to see when appropriate.

I also ask some theory questions like Josh suggested along with a few real world ML challenges we face to see if they have any creative solutions.  Since my group is very product focused and team members are self directed, I also try to get a sense of whether the candidate can come up with new products themselves that will make a difference for the company and our users.

What are the next big questions being asked in machine learning in 2019?,"This is a fun question to try to answer, since the answer ends up generating more questions! But, it may surprise some of you to learn that all of science works this way. Every scientific discovery, whether it be the discovery of the Big Bang or the discovery of DNA or the development of quantum mechanics, only leads to more questions. The greater the discovery, the more profound the questions it generates (e.g., what happened “before” the Big Bang?).

I don’t like to peg questions to years, since to me, a question that is worth asking may be something that takes years to pin down (scientists have been trying to understand Big Bang physics for decades now!).

So, here are 5 questions about ML and AI, and how it may shed light on the brain. These are of course generated by me on the spur of the moment, but as a 35 year veteran of ML and AI , I would like to get some answers to these questions.

The great English mathematician G.H. Hardy kept around a notebook of questions that he wanted to ask his Maker whenever he got the opportunity. First among his questions was whether the Riemann hypothesis was true (Riemann hypothesis - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis ]). It might sound like a quirky question to you, but to any mathematician of note, this question might really be at the top of their lists too.

So, in that spirit, when I get to meet my Maker, what questions would I ask? To keep this brief, I’ll limit myself to 5 questions.

1. Deep learning without gradient descent: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the most popular method for training neural networks. It is easy to implement, but painfully slow to learn, and despite what you read in the popular press, it is NOT how the brain works. The idea that 100 billion neurons in our brains are getting tuned at each time step with some chemical version of gradient descent seems awfully far fetched. Besides, we can easily learn complex concepts from one or two examples (how many examples of the dollar or Euro symbol do you need to see to recognize it henceforth?). So, SGD is not the solution we are looking for. What other approach could be used, other than SGD, which would give us similar sample efficiency that the brain exhibits? The late Nobel prize winning biologist, Gerard Edelman, who won the prize for elucidating the structure of the immune system, spent the remainder of his life trying to explore the structure of the brain. He came up with an intriguing hypothesis called “neural Darwinism” (Darwin's neuroscientist: Gerald M. Edelman, 1929–2014 [ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00896/full ]), wherein groups of interacting neurons compete with each other. Is this how the brain works? If it’s not SGD running the “machine”, what is it? I can’t think of a more important question to ask my Maker.
2. Modularity of the brain: it is by now an established fact that the brain is modular, in a very specific way that was beautifully elucidated in a book by Gerry Fodor (see The Modularity of Mind [ https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/modularity-mind ]). There are many ways to illustrate this concept. Consider some simple optical illusions. For example, in the below picture, why does it appear that the dots are always moving, when they are not (one reason is that tiny eye movements generate this illusion).
Consider the two central dots below. They are of the same size in reality, but appear to be of very different sizes.

Or consider the “cafe illusion”, first discovered by Richard Gregory from a wall in a cafe. The gray lines appear to be slanted, but they are actually straight.

If visual cognition is indeed the result of some “deep learning” process, why do we all suffer from the same optical illusions? Furthermore, why can’t we “teach” our brains (or our visual cortex) to undo the illusion? This is because the brain is modular. Your visual cortex is not under your direct conscious control.Similar examples can be given for other modalities (e.g., if you can speak English, or some other language, then speech in that language will always be interpreted by your brain as utterances in that language, and not puffs of air or sound, so there is no way to “turn off” your speech recognizer). This leads to the question: how much structure is built in to the brain at birth? How do we generate similarly structured deep networks, so that the mind of a robot is modular, and far more efficient to train than current highly sample inefficient approaches?

3. Correlation to causation: much of modern machine learning focuses on correlation, which is a simple measure of association between random variables. However, causal knowledge is far more useful in the world, particularly in reasoning about change. If I change this variable X, would it change Y (even if X and Y are correlated, that would not necessarily indicate causation). How does causal knowledge emerge from a cluster of deep learning networks, if that is what underlies our brain?

4. Developmental learning: Jean Piaget, the foremost developmental psychologist of the 20th century showed that children all over the world develop their mental capabilities in a number of broad phases. These have been experimentally confirmed with numerous experiments. Why does the child’s brain develop in this way, and what does it suggest for the way lifelong learning in machines should progress? In particular, how can we move deep learning from its current limited abilities to learn one specific task at a time, towards a more flexible framework where multiple tasks can be learned in parallel over years of experience?

5. OK, last question, so I better make it something interesting! Animal cognition researchers divide species into two categories based on something called the “mirror test”: does an animal shown its reflection in a mirror recognize itself and become conscious of its own self, or is it unable to understand that it is looking at a reflection of itself in the mirror? This test is taken as a proxy for whether animals are conscious of their own selves. What would it take for a machine to become self-aware?

What are the next big questions being asked in machine learning in 2019?,"Just for machine learning (not AI):

Q1 now you have this much publicity how will you continue to fund this activity - ie where will future revenues come from?

Machine learning has a limited use for most businesses. So what can be done to pay for more research in this technology? The link with AI is very tenuous so you can’t keep selling it on that basis. Image recognition is a way forward - so medical seems a good way forward. Satellite images would be another possibility. It does recognise quite quickly, but for real-time operations the domain is often too large for learning to be viable (self drive cars for example) . Factory inspection work however, is viable. Expansion into other patterns - so patterns in computer code might be plausible - looking for virus (this is being done by at least one compay).

What is the future of machine learning?,"There are many ways to answer this important question: financial, intellectual, societal, as well as political. ML has become such a major force in so many areas, from business growth and economic security to scientific development and political impact, that it is hard to overestimate its impact in the decades to come.

Let’s begin with the obvious, its economic and social impact. Let’s take just one example. Just yesterday, the co-founder of Facebook wrote an impassioned op-ed column in the New York Times calling for the US Government to dismantle Facebook, because he said, and I quote, “Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government”.

Opinion | It’s Time to Break Up Facebook [ https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html ]

Facebook and its associated products now reach 6 billion people on the planet. That’s a staggering number, by any standards, and without taking a personal stance one way or another on this issue (I don’t currently have a Facebook account, and never had one!), in large part what makes Facebook powerful is the ability to digest vast quantities of personal information about people through the use of machine learning.

It’s not restricted, of course, to Facebook. One can include Google, Amazon, Tesla, Uber, and so on. Virtually every major people-facing company is now employing the tools of machine learning to gather information on its customers, and seeking to exploit their data for commercial advantage. There is nothing inherently wrong or sinister about this process, but what alarms many observers is how the tools of machine learning now make it possible for individuals to have enormous power, far more than any king or queen ever had in human history. Machine learning makes this possible.

Every technology that affords such great power, throughout human history, including nuclear weapons, naval armadas, chariots, and now machine learning enabled software, needs to be used with caution. So, as the power of machine learning grows, its influence will become ever more dominant, and as the European Union did with GDPR, countries will slowly begin to rein in machine learning by exerting some amount of control. How far that happens will affect the extent to which machine learning continues to be the dominant technology in business, but as far as I can foresee, I don’t see anything happening in the near term that is going to affect the increasing deployment of machine learning and data mining tools.

A significant concern with using machine learning on global scales are issues, not just with privacy, but also of fairness. Machine learned models will reflect biases inherent in the data, and there are well documented cases of gender and racial biases in machine learning systems that are causing alarm. Machine learning is used to learn face recognition models, and there’s plenty of reason to be cautious in overly relying on such models.

Amazon’s Facial Recognition Wrongly Identifies 28 Lawmakers, A.C.L.U. Says [ https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/technology/amazon-aclu-facial-recognition-congress.html ]

In terms of scientific impact, machine learning is rapidly entering widespread use throughout all of science. In my own experience, in the last few years, I actively participated in an exciting project involving the application of machine learning to analyze data coming from the Mars rover, Curiosity. I saw first hand the impact of machine learning methods on planetary scientists, chemists, and astronomers who were quick to see the enormous benefits of being able to derive complex mappings from data.

For example, Curiosity uses a LIBS (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy) instrument to zap rocks, and beams back the emission spectra to Earth. The resulting spectra (a 6000-dimensional vector) tells planetary scientists something about the composition of rocks on Mars. Traditionally, planetary scientists use simple rules based on examining the peaks in the spectra: if you see this peak, then it probably reveals the presence of silicon dioxide (SiO2) etc. Well, now, with the modern tools of machine learning, we were able to show how based on a set of labeled data involving rocks on earth, one can quickly within a matter of milliseconds provide far more accurate analyses of Martian rocks, even to the point of discerning which laser readings to ignore, because they were contaminated by Martian dust. This is just one tiny example of the power of machine learning to influence many scientific studies, from biology to sociology.

Leaving aside these economic issues and application domains, one can ask what the major challenges are within machine learning itself. To me, if I had to try to summarize the major challenges that face ML, I would characterize the major open problems as follows:

1. Large datasets do not always lead to success: nowhere is this more obvious than language. ML enabled language models can now be run on text datasets that are many orders of magnitude larger than anything a single human can read over their lifetime. Yet, text-based learning methods have yet to come remotely close to the ability of humans in understanding language with all its richness. Humans use language in many ways, from giving commands to asking questions, to creative uses like poetry and metaphor. Take this beautiful poem by Emily Dickinson. She was a world-renowned poet who lived in Amherst, a small town in Western Massachusetts where I spent the last 16 years. Who can deny the beauty and depth of her verse? Can any language learning system understand, let alone produce, such verse?
“Because I could not stop for Death –
 He kindly stopped for me –
 The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
 And Immortality.”

2. Explaining how brains produce minds: current explanations of how neural activity result in intelligent action are highly inadequate and utterly unrealistic. Humans do not need millions of examples of dogs to tell them apart from cats. It is utterly implausible that some mysterious gradient descent procedure is tweaking the synaptic strength of hundreds of billions of neural connections, for every image, sound, or activity we perceive. This explanation becomes even more implausible when we see that individual neurons are largely communicating with each other using a kind of Morse code, sending spike trains of signals. How could this ever be reconciled with gradient methods? It remains a mystery.

3. Integrating knowledge and learning: current statistical learning systems are woefully inadequate in being able to represent the relational richness of the world. Currently, everything is converted to “vectors”, and this does a grave injustice to representing the richness of how social and political networks represent the world, not to mention scientific networks. Children go through a series of intellectual jumps in their early childhood, beautifully documented by the work of Jean Piaget and other developmental psychologists. Piaget showed how children gradually develop the abstract concept of an “object”. No machine learning system has ever been developed that can learn the abstract concept of an object. No deep learning system is capable of looking at a scene, and counting the number of objects in the scene, something a three year old child can do with ease.

All of these challenges will be addressed by future generations of researchers, and as they do, the power of machine learning will inevitably grow. The ultimate power of ML is hard to gauge, as it will depend to a great amount on societal and political issues, but for the foreseeable future, it is safe to say that ML’s influence is only going to skyrocket.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-next-big-questions-being-asked-in-machine-learning-in-2019?top_ans=140079892,2019-05-10T20:47:50.741527+00:00,,128,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6

Generally this means there is new math to do.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-next-big-questions-being-asked-in-machine-learning-in-2019?top_ans=778679,2011-10-24T20:29:17.198277+00:00,2013-11-13T08:22:39.303651+00:00,4,Charles H Martin,https://www.quora.com/profile/Charles-H-Martin
What will likely be the biggest machine learning advances of 2018?,"Machine learning (ML) as a field is highly unpredictable as there are many interesting potential breakthroughs in transfer learning, adversarial examples, one/zero shot learning, learning to learn, reinforcement learning (RL), memory networks, reasoning and attention.

There is a lot of research work in making models more robust to adversarial examples.

Learning to learn or meta-learning which is about models that learn automatically given only the data is a path towards general intelligence or general purpose machine learning whereby, the only requirement is to provide the data and the models will figure out their hyperparameters automatically.

I think it is a very important thing for ML models to learn everything because currently ML researchers/engineers spend a great deal of time working out the model hyperparameters that work best. If a model can learn on it’s own, given only the data then that would be a great way to have general purpose accessible ML models.

Though it is very computationally expensive because in actual sense the methods used to currently achieve meta-learning are based on evolution to evolve the best neural network architectures.

Reinforcement learning can also be used to search for the right hyperparameters whereby the accuracy of a model is used as the reward/punishment signal.

Such methods that allow models to find their own optimized hyperparameters like Google AutoML is a potential hot area that is likely to see substantial amount of progress in 2018.

The computation demand comes in because for every potential model, it must be trained and evaluated. This means Google Cloud computing running AutoML must be heavily equiped with some serious compute power. Especially if more businesses start trying out AutoML, I fear the compute resources might get overwhelmed.

Zero/one shot learning is very important because it can allow models to learn from very few to no learning examples. AlphaGo Zero actually used zero examples to learn but it had to go through millions of training iterations.

In actual zero/one shot learning, transfer learning plays a major role because transferring knowledge from one problem to another reduces the need for a lot of training data.


Thus if I have to pick which areas will see the most progress in 2018 I would pick:

 * Learning to learn.
 * Transfer learning.
 * And adversarial examples problem.
Not to mention that we need to start looking at unsupervised learning methods as well as learning from richer datasets like videos.

Hope this helps.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-next-big-questions-being-asked-in-machine-learning-in-2019?top_ans=70292581,2018-01-19T18:22:59.158516+00:00,2018-01-19T18:27:05.701547+00:00,34,Chomba Bupe,https://www.quora.com/profile/Chomba-Bupe

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"We'd ask the following types/examples of questions, not all of which are considered pass/fail, but do give us a reasonable comprehensive picture of the candidate's depth in this area.

In general, pick one or two (that the candidate is good at) and keep going deeper and deeper, rather than go horizontally through some checklist. It is far more indicative of depth.

General mastery: when you really understand something (e.g., you've gone through the cycle of learning-doing-teaching-doing), you can express seemingly complex concepts in simple ways. Or you develop insightful views on things at a broader level and can explain it to others. E.g.,:
1. Discuss your views on the relationship between machine learning and statistics.

2. Talk about how Deep Learning (or XYZ method) fits (or not?) within the field.

3. Isn't it all just curve fitting? Talk about that.

4. How are kernel methods different?

5. Why do we need/want the bias term?

6. Why do we call it GLM when it's clearly non-linear? (somewhat tricky question, to be asked somewhat humorously---but extremely revealing.)

7. How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms? What are Fourier transforms, for that matter?

8. Etc.


ML skills specific: E.g.,
1. Pick an algorithm you like and walk me through the math and then the implementation of it, in pseudo-code.
2. OK now let's pick another one, maybe more advanced.
3. Discuss the meaning of the ROC curve, and write pseudo-code to generate the data for such a curve.
4. Discuss how you go about feature engineering (look for both intuition and specific evaluation techniques).
5. Etc.

Distributed systems (our needs): E.g.,
1. Discuss MapReduce (or your favorite parallelization abstraction). Why is MapReduce referred to as a ""shared-nothing"" architecture (clearly the nodes have to share something, no?) What are the advantages/disadvantages of ""shared-nothing""?
2. Pick an algorithm. Write the pseudo-code for its parallel version.
3. What are the trade-offs between closed-form and iterative implementations of an algorithm, in the context of distributed systems?
4. Etc.

Other (hands-on experience, past accomplishments, etc.):
1. Do you have experience with R (or Weka, Scikit-learn, SAS, Spark, etc.)? Tell me what you've done with that. Write some example data pipelines in that environment.
2. Tell me about a time when you ... { worked on a project involving ML ; optimized an algorithm for performance/accuracy/etc. }
3. Estimate the amount of time in your past project spent on each segment of your data mining/machine learning work.

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"Rather than just share a comprehensive list of questions, I thought I could add value by talking about this from a different angle.

I’ve realized that many people, when giving advice on ML interview prep, miss one of the most crucial aspects of the process: that there are actually two “parts” to the interview, representing two different types of questions you might be asked.

1. Questions about your specific knowledge of ML theory. Importantly, these are generally questions that have a particular correct answer that the interviewer is looking for. You might be asked about things like bias and variance, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, Bayes’ Theorem and how to use it, how to avoid overfitting models, and other such questions.

Of course, the above is critical. If you don’t understand the core concepts of Machine Learning, it will be tough for you to ever become an outstanding machine learning engineer, and a major company wouldn’t take a risk on hiring you - regardless of how charming your smile is.

If you’re interested, here’s a relevant list of practice questions [ https://www.educative.io/blog/top-machine-learning-interview-questions ].

However, I argue that candidates spend way too much time preparing for the above, and not enough on the second category of ML interview questions:

2. Machine Learning system design questions. These are open-ended questions that don’t have a particular correct answer you can quote. Instead, you will be asked to think about, make decisions, and explain your logic in designing a complex system.

Some examples of such questions include:

 * Design a search ranking system for a search engine
 * Design a recommendation system for a Netflix-like platform
 * Design a Twitter-like feed system that shows people the most relevant Tweets to them
 * Design an ad prediction system to show relevant ads to users
As you can see, questions like these require you to integrate your knowledge of ML theory with the ability to “zoom out” and think about real-world ML problems at a high level. More so than your specific solutions, interviewers are interested in hearing about how you approach such problems. What factors do you consider? What tradeoffs do you make? Why?

Your performance on questions like these makes a huge difference on not just your hire/no hire decision, but also your hiring level, which is often just as important and can make a huge difference on your salary.

There aren’t too many resources out there that will help you prepare for ML system design questions. The best one for it is Grokking the Machine Learning Interview [ https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-machine-learning-interview ], which focuses on the system design aspect of ML in depth.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-questions-I-can-expect-in-Machine-Learning-interview-specifically-for-my-ML-projects?top_ans=246647520,2020-10-29T00:43:43.510738+00:00,,172,Fahim ul Haq,https://www.quora.com/profile/Fahim-ul-Haq
What types of technical questions are most commonly asked in Senior Machine Learning Engineer interviews?,"Every place I’ve interviewed with or worked at had a similar process.

As an aside, Microsoft uses me as an interview resource. Internal Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to set up or participate in interviews outside of Microsoft so when a client asks them, they’ll use outside resources.

Here’s the basic process.

They have a phone screen to ascertain your technical acumen.

Our phone screen is all data. Here’s a short list to prepare you for the phone screen. [ https://www.machinelearningmike.com/post/phone-screen-preparation ]

All of our models are on structured data and we use BigQuery so if you don’t have strong data skills, we end the phone screen. Most companies do the same thing. We actually won’t interview anyone without 3–5 years of SQL in a real-world setting. Teaching data skills is far more difficult than Python or modeling basics.

So, we start easy.

What are the two types of SQL?

What’s a relational database?

What’s a table?

What the difference between structured data and unstructured data?

How do you create a table?

In the phone screen, we also throw in a few Python questions. Easy shit… like what does a single equals sign mean? What’s an equality operator? What’s a model called in SciKit-Learn.

If you make it past the phone screen you have your first in-person.

This is where we dive into machine learning. Again, starting off simple like… can you whiteboard out the machine learning pipeline?

Can you draw a simple ANN? What’s the difference between deep learning and an ANN?

After the candidate makes it past these it’s on to coding questions in Python, Pandas, SciKit-Learn.

Then basic stats questions. All applied questions.

Then I’ll put up Jupyter Notebook with an end to end pipeline and have them walk me through each line of code.

Like…

import pandas as pd %3CTell me what every word means.

The word import means to “bring in”

Pandas is a library for data manipulation.

as pd is an alias. An alias is used so you don’t have to write out the entire library during the call.

We have about 100 questions. It’s really important to understand, companies aren’t going to pay you 200K to learn on the job.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-questions-I-can-expect-in-Machine-Learning-interview-specifically-for-my-ML-projects?top_ans=190355055,2020-01-05T20:18:07.193777+00:00,2020-01-24T21:29:24.650467+00:00,200,Mike West,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-West-99
How do I crack any machine learning interview? What kinds of questions should I expect? What types of relevant side projects would look good on a CV?,"I think it would be hard to prepare to crack 'any' machine learning interview without years of study because machine learning is a broad field.  It would be much more efficient to select a specific area of machine learning (like deep learning or reinforcement learning or clustering) and to focus on passing any interview in just that area.

If you want to be able to pass any machine learning interview, one option would be to get a degree like a MS in machine learning.  A PhD degree will go quite narrow, and you're unlikely to get much out of the years of independent research that would generalize to many areas of machine learning.  You could therefore enroll in such a MS program or find syllabi of graduate ML courses and study materials on those syllabi.

You'd also want to get real-world experience with the methods described in the books and papers, as ML interviews will often involve some discussion about your projects.

Finally, you'd need to be very comfortable with probability and statistics.  This would hopefully come from the MS courses, but it would also help to have taken at least one full probability course to be introduced to probabilistic intuition and a full statistics course to be introduced to statistical thinking.

To answer sub-questions on your original question:

What kinds of questions to expect?

I'm just making these up, but I think they're also fairly standard:

 * derive the update equation for linear regression
 * how do you handle categorical variables with linear regression?
 * explain logistic regression
 * tell me how you (as a data scientist at Foursquare) might figure out which restaurant a person is in given their lat/long.
 * tell me what EM is
 * no, seriously, what objective is EM maximizing?
 * how would you do feature selection on such-and-such a project?
 * what do you do when your data has missing / incorrect values?
 * tell me about such-and-such a project on your resume
 * why is convexity important for learning algorithms?
What kinds of relevant side projects would look good when added in CV?

 * a project where you had to collect the data yourself, e.g. scraping products reviews from a website
 * a project where you had to deal with missing or messy data, e.g. cases where some people provide their location and some people don't
 * a project where you had to figure out an appropriate ""ground truth"".  maybe it was clicks; maybe it was human labels; maybe it was an unsupervised method
 * a project where there are lots of places to apply statistical reasoning, i.e., not just a flat table of data
 * a project where the application of machine learning is solving an important problem (you can use ML on anything; whether it's useful is another question), e.g. predicting whether people describing symptoms on a medical forum are eventually diagnosed with a disease.

What questions are asked in interviews?,"There are some basic questions for which you can prepare and then there are some questions which are completely guided by your responses. You have to play with your mind and prepare for them beforehand just like we prepare attack lines in chess. 

Here are some questions which you must prepare :

Q.  Tell me some thing about yourself.
This is the question from where YOU can direct the panel and urge them to ask the questions from your specific interest.

Q. Why do you want to join this institute?
This is one question you should answer honestly and pragmatically. Ideally you should choose an institute based on certain criteria. Such as Ranking/ placements, Courses offered, Fee, Location

Do some research, ask from your seniors. An informed analysis of the institute can convince the interviewer that you are sincerely interested.

Q. Which other institutes have you applied to?
This is a question that is very much linked to the previous question. For example, if you say that you had chosen IRMA because you have a flair for Rural Marketing and while answering this question you don't mention  the name of other institutes known to offer quality course in Rural Marketing you are in trouble. So these two questions are to be prepared simultaneously avoiding conflicts in answers.

Q. How will you add value to this institute if you make it through?
This is an opportunity to showcase your strengths but remember it is essential that your strengths should be supported by related achievements.Give a real life example to convince the panel.
Your background and circumstances can also be your strengths and can be used as equally important points in supporting your answer.
Remember, an achievement doesn't necessarily mean a prize. It can also be your successfully coming out of a crisis situation or you managing to run a small project with your friends.

Q. What do you consider your greatest weakness?
CAUTION: This is not an opportunity to pour out your darkest secrets. This is a question that is best played down. For example, if you are overweight, you may mention -- ""I have been trying to shed weight for the last  few years but couldn't do it still."" The answer should be framed so that it does not reflect badly on your career thus far, or your future career.

Another way of answering would be a smart statement: ""I have never allowed failure to drag me down. I just got up, took my lesson and picked my way forward."" Here it would help to have a certain experience picked  out.      

Most career books tell you to select a strength and present it as a weakness. Such as: “I work too much. I just work and work and work.” Wrong. First of all, using a strength and presenting it as a weakness is  deceiving. Second, it misses the point of the question.

You should select a weakness that you have been actively working to overcome. For example: “I have had trouble in the past with planning and prioritization. However, I’m now taking steps to correct this. I just started  using a pocket planner . . .” then show them your planner and how you are using it.
     
Talk about a true weakness and show what you are doing to overcome it.

Q. Why have you chosen this career?
This is an area where a mature and realistic answer is expected. People choose their career based on several reasons, such as:

What is your aptitude?
What kind of a social, professional and personal environment do you desire?
What is your background and achievements?
What motivates you?
What activities do you enjoy?

Q. What is the last book you read?
Many experts would tell you that you should know the ins and out of the books and everything about the author and his writing style. If you know these facts, it can't hurt, but if you are not the kind of a person who  would research the background and other facts about books, but read for fun, it is okay to mention it. The only thing is that your answer should be natural, convincing and rational.

For example, if the interviewer asks you for more detail about the author you may just reply.

""I'm sorry but I haven't read much about the author. But I liked this book because...""

Q. How will your contribute to this campus if we select you?
This is a question that directly relates to your strengths and aspiration. Take this as an opportunity to showcase the various qualities that you possess which may benefit the college, academically, culturally or in any  other way.

Q.  Where do you see yourself 10 years from now?
This is not when you start throwing in fancy designations. Instead, concentrate on the kind of roles people in those designations are expected to play. If the question specifically asks for your professional goals then  stick to it, otherwise it is a good idea to balance it with your personal goals.       

Q. Who is your role model?
Your role model can be anyone a public figure or even someone from your family. It is a good idea to know a lot about the person you would make your role model. It is important to focus on the qualities that inspire  you and how you try to inculcate those qualities in yourself. It is always important to tell why s/he is different from her/his peers.

Q.If you had to live your life over again, what one thing would you change?
Focus on a key turning point in your life or missed opportunity. Yet also tie it forward to what you are doing to still seek to make that change.
      For example: “Although I’m overall very happy with where I’m at in my life, the one aspect I likely would have changed would be focusing earlier on my chosen career. I had a great internship this past year and look  forward to more experience in the field. I simply wish I would have focused here earlier.
For example, I learned on my recent internship…” …then provide examples.
      Stay focused on positive direction in your life and back it up with examples.

Q. Do your have any questions for me?
""No"" would be a bad answer. It is good to have a few questions that relate to the academic and cultural environment of the institution. This will show your enthusiasm.

3 Mistakes MBA aspirants make!

1. Blaming your College/School Professor for low scores: You are always 100% responsible for your grades. If you have low scores then don’t ever state that your teacher did not clarify the subject or rushed the topic.  Do you think studies at IIM’s or any MBA institutes are designed to be studied in an easy relaxed spoon fed manner? Wrong the MBA curriculum is a real test of your abilities to stay awake and perform at your best. If  you blame your teachers - you are out.

2. Blaming ill health: What are you LOSER NO 1? If exam days give you bad health, how will you be able to achieve corporate profit targets? Unless you are actually physically handicapped you cannot be expected to  fall ill under mysterious circumstances whenever pressure builds around you. Even if you were truly sick - try to come out with some other reason for your lack of extra curricular activities or low scores.

3. State hobbies just for the heck of it: OK so you enjoy cricket. Do you know the technical details of the game? How many members are there in the BCCI governing council? The IIM professors do not appreciate  mere couch potatoes. Hobbies are not merely for adding spice to your CV. State only 2 hobbies and try to learn everything there is to that hobby.

The MBA Personal Interview is actually tougher than job interviews. In job interviews they actually need manpower so they don’t ask tough questions. Here you are being SHORTLISTED against equally capable  competitors so they are trying to find means to NOT SELECT you. So be careful with your replies.

1. Compare random forest and decision tree models. Which works better?
2. How would you train a classifier on an imbalanced dataset?
3. What are the different types of learning rate optimizers?
4. What is the cross-entropy loss? Is it convex or not?
5. What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? When to use L1?
6. What is the difference between MAE, MAPE, and MSE? How would you decide when to use which metric?
7. Why do you use feature selection?
8. What's the difference between R-CNN and YOLO?
9. Assuming a clustering model's labels are known, how do you evaluate the model's performance?
10. How do you prevent overfitting?

5. ML System Design:
6. 
1. What would you do to summarize an Instagram feed?
2. How would you design a system to optimize Microsoft's go-to-market strategy?
3. How would you detect if multimedia content being posted on Facebook violates the terms or contains offensive materials?
4. Build a model to predict which people are most likely to take a loan from the bank.

You can answer a lot of these questions with enough preparation.

What are some common machine learning interview questions?,"When I am asked to interview people, I try to ascertain whether they know the math or not, and how to apply it  in a real world context.  I also look to see if they understand high performance computing and not just vanilla coding.  

I was asked to do this as a consultant, acting as a subject matter expert to help interview junior people for the firm.  

In our interviews, we asked a candidate to present some code they had written and to talk through it.   For an ML person, it would be some kind of ML code.

So, for example, I was involved with an interview with a Physics PhD from MIT discussing some NMF code he wrote in javascript.   The javascript was very good and he would be fine doing GUI work , Node.JS work, etc.  Certainly not something I could do.

Can he do Machine Learning.  Mind you, he has a PhD in a math heavy subject from one of the top 10 schools in the world.  So he should know the math.

I wanted to see if he knew how to get it to converge properly.  He did not.     He knew it was non-convex, but he did not know how to seed it, nor did he know about the convex variants. He tried to give me some nonsense about it being Bi-convex and whatnot. Dude, just use Kmeans++  to seed it.  Thats it.  Thats all you had to say.   This got totally past the VP of engineering and the CTO.    (They were just impressed that machine learning involved computing a first order derivative--something neither had since since college calculus)

So here, he knew some basic methods, but did not really know the most important ideas in the field, the important developments,  how to really code this.  It is clear that he had never done anything like this in his former work, nor did he really understand numerical methods.

This means that his solution would never work in production and -- more importantly -- that he would have no idea how to evaluate it or how to  fix it.  I see this a lot.   Also, he did not know the available open source codes, how they worked internally, and  which one to use,  or how to evaluate their performance.  For being a PhD from MIT, this was unacceptable to me.

There was also a code evaluation.  For me, one needs to know what runs fast and what does not. What good is a method that only runs on 300 data points?!     In this case, this interviewee had written his own javascript matrix library.  Did he know the BLAS libraries and how they work?  Or an alternative?     This is critical because you can't run anything in production if the code is too slow.   I see the same problem with most ruby coders--they just don't know numerical computing.    

I was not looking to evaluate 10,000 of complex code , whether he used Agile or Unit Testing.  Nor did I care about solving some high school brain teaser. I just wanted to see a small piece of code, with good engineering choices ,   a good understanding of the math, and how to make this solution work in a modest production environment . 

Id rather see old fashioned spectral clustering with a  Fortran library, which can scale, as opposed to trying to use a ""fancy"" method like NMF or LDA if you can not get it to work in production at scale.  (I'm not saying they don't scale--I am saying you better know how to get them to scale if you choose to use them)

In another interview, again a PhD (Ukrainian I think) who was very bright and had solved some good problems and had experience.  He was using an off-the-shelf SVM tool--a tool I know very well.   I asked a very basic question--how do you adjust the cost parameter for the SVM regularizer.   I rephrased the question a couple of different ways to give him a chance.    FAIL   In other words, did you read the documentation of the tool and did you understand which parameters to tweak and which ones to leave at the default settings  ( I kinda would like the person to have read the entire source code of the tool and know how it works. )   Again, this demonstrates a failure of the most basic mathematical concepts in ML -- Regularization-- and how they would apply in production.  Tuning this parameter can increase accuracy by %10-15 (or more).  Again, just simple stuff--but important stuff  This also shows a lack of attention to notice the important details of the work.  We actually offered this guy the job and he asked for a salary way out of the ballpark.  If he had not missed this critical question he might have been able to make the case for the salary.


Having shared all this, I would add that I think , for you, the market is very good and you will probably not encounter anything like this.  Why?  All you need to do is know more machine learning than the VP and the CTO--and here the bar is very low.   Everyone and his brother has a funding to do machine learning and they usually just need to solve one small problem and get the product out the door.  Most  (i.e 7/10 ) CTOs and VPs know absolutely nothing about even basic   machine learning  so they have no clue  even what to  ask. (Newton Raphson will blow them away, and they will think you are too expensive if you try compare stochastic gradient descent to interior point methods)  They got their start up funded based on the market potential of  the idea, and they are expected to hire people to invent their IP. 

  (Obviously if you are interviewing at Google or Lockheed Martin, disregard all of this and hire me once you get in)

P.S.   I was asked once by some VP/CTO evaluating me what the volume of a rectangular prism is.  AlI could think of was this old Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon  with the Prism on it 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon

I would never ask this kind of question but you will probably get asked many   puzzle questions like this if you are fresh out of school (or an old man like me I guess)  I seem to recall there are books and/or web sites with tons of these.

What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?,"I ask them to attack some common machine learning problems from the web domain that most machine learning researchers should have heard of.  It can be hard to bring people up to speed on your problem domain during a short interview, so I try to ask more familiar questions like ""How would you approach the Netflix Prize?"", ""How would you generate related searches on Bing?"", ""How would you suggest followers on Twitter?"".

I ask them to describe a ""Rolls Royce"" solution that you could implement in 3 months, then a version you could implement in 3 weeks, and another version you could implement if you only had 3 days.  This tells you how adaptable they are and if they can come up with pragmatic approaches.

Most of the things we build need to scale, so I probe them about how their approach would work on large amounts of data.  MapReduce based solutions are nice to see when appropriate.

I also ask some theory questions like Josh suggested along with a few real world ML challenges we face to see if they have any creative solutions.  Since my group is very product focused and team members are self directed, I also try to get a sense of whether the candidate can come up with new products themselves that will make a difference for the company and our users.

** Another type of question I often ask involves finding or collecting your own training data.  Most applicants have only worked with toy datasets or data where the labeled examples were provided to them.  I pose a typical machine learning problem they might face, and ask how they would quickly gather additional data to help solve it.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-questions-I-can-expect-in-Machine-Learning-interview-specifically-for-my-ML-projects?top_ans=85281,2010-08-17T23:55:24.117976+00:00,2010-10-11T08:21:17.136060+00:00,389,Peter Skomoroch,https://www.quora.com/profile/Peter-Skomoroch
How do I crack any machine learning interview? What kinds of questions should I expect? What types of relevant side projects would look good on a CV?,"Edited: Question was edited to explicitly exclude this type of answer, but I believe still  relevant for those seeking to prepare for an interview. 

Don't!

I keep giving the same answer, the best way to pass an interview is to be qualified for the position. If you are in fact qualified for the position a good interviewer will realize that. A good interviewer can't be tricked, and you want to work for a good interviewer.  There is little point in looking for shortcuts hoping to fool an interviewer on what you know. You should be honest in your resume, a good interviewer will try to verify you know what you claim you know and not bother with details which might give bonus points but you never claimed you know. 

I myself have found myself getting asked a C++ question because I never erased it from my resume. I fumbled it, it wasn't terribly important for the job, but the interviewer wanted to know if I in fact know everything I said I know, and he did so by randomly selecting a minor item from my resume. He was well within his right and I was wrong for not cleaning up my resume.

Get hired based on who you are and what you know, don't take a job if you weren't challenged in the interview process. If the interview process can be tricked with a few tips from Quora many of your future co-workers got in that way, don't take the job.

Focus on getting hired by good companies.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-questions-I-can-expect-in-Machine-Learning-interview-specifically-for-my-ML-projects?top_ans=18948488,2016-01-24T15:25:23.590994+00:00,2016-01-24T20:27:47.687752+00:00,23,Meir Maor,https://www.quora.com/profile/Meir-Maor
What kind of interview questions should I expect for data scientist: machine learning?,"There are a lot of different types of questions you can expect, but they fall into four different categories:

1. “You know it or you don’t”
2. “Tell me about..”
3. Non-technical questions
4. Whiteboard problem-solving questions
The first type of questions are those you find when you do a search for “data science interview questions”. There are some good answers here. Stuff like “What is a ROC curve used for?”, “When would you use naive Bayes?”, and maybe even “How would you explain overfitting to your grandmother.” Either you know it or you don’t.

The second types are to gauge your experience. “Tell me about the time you had a difficult data set to clean.” Or maybe “Tell me about a time you suspected target leakage and how did you determine whether it was happening?” I had someone once ask me what my favorite R package is. They are trying to gauge whether you’ve actually had some experience outside of courses.

The third type should not be ignored. They are just as important as the others. When someone asks you, “Tell me about yourself,” you’d better have an awesome answer ready to go.

The fourth type are the most difficult. They are basically oral exams and not only judge your technical knowledge but your ability to think through problems. I recently conducted a series of mock whiteboard interviews with senior data scientists asking questions of beginning ones looking for their first job. When someone is staring at you, it can be difficult to think through something and remember the basics. Your best bet is to get together with others at your same level and practice doing these types of problems yourself.

Some things you should know:

 * Intuitive explanations of what common algorithms are trying to do (decision trees: recursive partitioning of the data to get homogenous subsets)
 * How to detect and handle common problems (e.g., overfitting, imbalance, missing values)
 * Decision points and how to make a choice (e.g., selecting a threshold for a binary classification problem to get the right balance between false positives and false negatives or maybe based on base rate)
 * Various measures of performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1, R^2, RMSE, etc.)
There’s a lot to know so what I’ve tried to do here is give you a top-level overview of what you can expect.

Good luck!",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-questions-I-can-expect-in-Machine-Learning-interview-specifically-for-my-ML-projects?top_ans=132933262,2019-04-09T20:05:54.259935+00:00,,3,Mark Meloon,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Meloon
What kind of technical questions can I expect in a machine learning interview?,"Almost of our phone screen is data related. It’s 90% SQL, Pandas, data sourcing and data wrangling questions. This weeds out a lot of statisticians and mathematicians turned machine learning engineer.

What’s a primary key? What’s an inner join? What’s a where clause do? How do you retrieve the min and max values from a column? What’s a Dataframe? What object does a Dataframe sit on top of? What does a single equals sign mean in Python? What’s an attribute?

If the candidate can’t source data then the interview is over.

Most won’t make it past the phone screen.

The first in-person is more data related questions, cloud questions, modeling and model tuning.

We look for a solid understanding of the machine learning process as it relates to the real world.

We ask scenario based questions like:

You have data in a SQL Server database that’s 500 gigs in size. How do you get that data to a cloud provider so it can be molded at scale? It can be answered quite a few ways but only if you’ve done it before.

We also do a lot of white boarding like everyone else. For example, draw a liner regression model. Now, draw a classification model. Now, tell me what’s special about those two models? You should know that most real world modeling is either classification or regression and be able to explain it to a project manager so he/she can understand it.

We also do many one liners you should know without thinking. For example:

What’s supervised machine learning?

What’s the machine learning pipeline?

Define data wrangling?

What’s an array? How do you find values in an array? What’s so special about the array?

What model do you start with when modeling highly structured data?

What are some basic projects in machine learning?,"The best way to learn Machine Learning, or for that matter any skill, is to take-up projects. Projects help you get a realistic perspective of how things work at the ground level. Here are some interesting project ideas in Machine Learning which you may want to work on in order to build a great resume:

 * Handwritten Digit Recognition: this is the standard project that everyone takes-up and you should also do it. The project is about one of the simplest Machine Learning datasets - “the MNIST dataset [ http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ ]” which contains a set of handwritten images containing numbers from 0 to 9 and you are asked to train a Machine Learning algorithm that can correctly identify the digits. By taking up this project, you will learn a lot of aspects of Machine Learning - loading and cleaning data, data preprocessing, applying various ML algorithms on a given set of data, finding the right metrics to measure the algorithm performance, etc.
 * House Price Prediction: House Price Prediction problem [ https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data ] is another interesting problem that is focused more on applying Regression techniques. Linear Regression is a simple, yet powerful Machine Learning algorithm and knowing how to apply it would be extremely useful to solve a variety of ML problems. Further, if you ever apply for an ML-related job, expect a question or 2 around Linear Regression.
 * COVID-19 Global Forecasting: this is a new problem that has emerged in the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Here is the dataset [ https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-1/data ]. The world is going through a crisis and any contribution from the Technology community in terms of predictions or helping the society would certainly be beneficial.
 * Iris Flower Prediction Dataset: The Iris dataset [ https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ] contains 3 flower classes of 50 rows each containing the data-points like the height of petal, the width of petal, the height of sepal, and width of the sepal. Based on these 4 parameters, you are supposed to classify a new data-point into one of the 3 flower classes.
 * Titanic Survival Prediction: This is the “Hello World! problem on Kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data ]”. The idea is to use parameters like age, gender, etc., and predict whether the person survived the Titanic crash or not. There are some interesting observations which you will learn about when you play with the Titanic Dataset.
Some other problems which are of interest to the world:

 * Sentiment Analysis: analyzing sentiment is an old problem. Every day new solutions to this problem are being created to solve this problem.
 * Credit Card Fraud Detection: a relatively well-known problem which is also quite important for the Industry. If you build something around it, Banks would love to purchase.
 * Insurance Fraudulent Claim Detection: Insurance companies spend millions of dollars every year to ensure that they don’t pay out a fraudulent claim. If someone solves this problem, they will make a ton of money.
I would recommend the below resources to learn ML and take-up projects:

 * Andrew Ng’s Course on Coursera [ https://bit.ly/1IXp8Lg ]
 * Udacity’s Machine Learning Course [ https://bit.ly/1JqYWZy ]
 * A Course on Learn Machine Learning by Building Projects [ https://bit.ly/2NVeC6b ]

What are the best interview questions to evaluate a machine learning researcher?,"I try to ask very basic but fundamental questions to see if they actually understand the math

 I would expect everyone to know how to solve

Ax=b

And to know the difference between a convex and non-convex solution.


Finding any reasonable candidate is quite hard, and the real goal is to disqualify people.  This is usually enough to weed out %90 of the posers.

Also, there are lots of ways to solve the same problem, and ML is a big field.
Keeping it simple and basic is important. 

At this point, it might be useful to ask about regularization.  It's enough to understand that A^{-1} is ill conditioned; although that would weed out %99 of the candidates, and no one could fill the role.  

I generally don't ask questions like ""implement logistic regression"" unless the job actual involved writing custom solvers since doing this well is hard, and implementing a simple solution is pointless  counterproductive. (I have seen new hires try this and fall flat on their a$$).  

 I would rather they know how that running NMF will bomb out if you don't seed it properly, how to adjust the cost parameter on liblinear , or just knowing what Newton's method is  

---

 Note that the real key to evaluate a PhD level researcher, however, is to determine if they are capable of doing independent research (if the job actually entails this), or if they just did what their advisor told them to do.   Here, one wants to see if they have a broad knowledge of the own field and how creative their PhD research was.  This is not, however, necessarily part of the interview process but more part of the screening process.

 When I evaluate a more senior person, especially an older PhD,  I use the old University of Chicago whiteboard method, meaning that anything someone brings up, they had better be able to go to the whiteboard (or chalkboard, in the old days) and work through the math.  This is absolutely critical, because it is necessary to see if you have kept yours math skills up and also to see if think using language or you think using math.   Thinking in math is hard and requires you maintain the skill.

What are the most interesting questions about machine learning asked on Quora?,"They’re quite subtle in how they are formulated.

A lot of the time, an interesting question is not nessecarily meant to be so - nor is it revealing to be so.

It sometimes, has been that the question is a genuine “But why?”

As in, they did some project - something went wrong - why?

Other times, it’s about very specific dynamics that has no clear answer.

A lot of the times, whenever people ask about ML, the questions are very complex.

Because, it’s not as simple - in truth - as saying “Well, due to using a SELU or that you constructed a 5 layer of RNN’s with said Algorithmics etc. it caused the divergent at timestep X due to set belonging gradient partitioning on this fractional interplay with bounds of etc. etc.”

I mean, that isolated piece of knowledge - might be true - but, it fairly rarely answers the question.

Thus, the most interesting questions - are the ones that are legitimate questions - Things you can’t reasonably procure an answer to, without some intimate knowledge or some source of strong reasoning.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-questions-about-machine-learning-asked-on-Quora?top_ans=88020019,2018-06-19T15:00:43.049684+00:00,2018-06-19T16:47:35.334457+00:00,0,Mikael Rusin,https://www.quora.com/profile/Mikael-Rusin
What are interesting topics in machine learning?,"Instead of giving you a list of interesting topics in machine learning, I’ll give you one specific topic: Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs.

GANs are one of the most exciting topics in machine learning. Very broadly, a GAN is a neural network ‘system’ comprising of 2 neural networks trying to outdo each other (adversaries to each other).

Say your goal is to have an algorithm generate a high quality photo-realistic image. By generate, we mean create a new image, an image it has never seen before. GANs are the currently most successful algorithm for this problem. You have a neural network G, which tries to generate images. And you have another neural network D, which tries to distinguish generated (fake) images from real images (say images downloaded from the web). The two networks are trying to outdo each other.

G starts by generating completely noisy looking output, but continually improves as it tries to fool D. But D keeps getting better too. Eventually, both get really good, and we have the best image generator system currently known.

Zhao,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ben-Y-Zhao
How does Quora use machine learning in 2015?,"One of the reasons I was excited to join Quora as VP of Engineering was how important machine learning was for the company's success. As of 2015, machine learning approaches are used extensively in many different parts of the Quora product. Most of these applications were in place before I joined. However, we are constantly coming up with new approaches and making big improvements to the existing ones. It is important to note that all these improvements are first optimized and tested offline by using many different kinds of offline metrics but are always finally tested online through A/B tests.

In the following paragraphs, I will describe some of the most important applications and techniques of ML at Quora as of 2015.

Ranking

Ranking is arguably one of the most important applications of machine learning on the Web. Companies ranging from very large to small have created business models around the ability to rank, for example, results to a query string. At Quora we use ranking algorithms in different contexts and with different purposes.

One interesting example is answer ranking. Given a question and several answers to this question, we are interested in ranking them in decreasing order so to keep the “best” answer at the top and the worst at the bottom (see screen capture below).

There are many different features that could go into determining the right order of the answers to a question. In order to determine that, we actually first need to determine what we at Quora define as a “good” answer. One good way to come up with that definition is to look at what Quora considers a “helpful answer” [ https://www.quora.com/What-does-a-good-answer-on-Quora-look-like-What-does-it-mean-to-be-helpful/answer/Quora ]. You will read about answers being “truthful”, “reusable”, “provide explanation”, or “well formatted” among others. Our machine learning algorithm, which implements a particular learning-to-rank approach, has many different features that try to encode many dimensions that ultimately relate to all those abstract concepts. For example, we have features that encode information about the quality of the writing, but also use features that inform about the kind of interactions that the answer received (e.g. upvotes, downvotes, or expands). We also have features related to the user who wrote the answer including, for example, the expertise of the user in the question topic.

We have many other applications of ranking at Quora, some of which might even go unnoticed. For example, the names that appear as having upvoted a given answer are also ranked in a way that we present at top the ones that we consider are most informative for that given question/answer. The same is true for those names that are suggested when presenting possible answerers to a particular question.

Let's take a closer look at two particular instances of ranking ML algorithms: Search, and Personalized Ranking.

Search algorithms

For an application such as Quora, search algorithms can be seen as just another application of ranking. As a matter of fact, search can be decomposed into two different steps: textual matching + ranking. In the first step, documents (questions) that match the query entered in the search box in some way are returned. Those documents are then treated as candidates of the second step, which ranks those results in order to optimize something such as the probability of click.

This second step is indeed another example of learning-to-rank application where many different features can be used. These features can go from simple textual features that were already used in the original textual matching step to others that relate to user actions, or object properties such as its popularity.

Personalized Ranking

In some situations such as the one outlined above, we might get by with a global optimal ranking for all users. In other words, we can assume that the order for most “helpful” answers to a given question is independent of the user who is reading the answer. That assumption clearly fails in many important cases though. One such very important case is the Quora Feed. The Quora Feed is basically the homepage that any user sees when logging into the product. In that page, we are trying to select and rank the most “interesting” stories for that given user at a given time (see example below). This is a prototypical example of personalized learning-to-rank, similar to what the Netflix homepage does with Movies and TV Shows.

The Quora use-case though is a bit more challenging than the one of ranking movies and TV shows at Netflix. As a matter of fact, one could look at our use case as a combination of what Netflix, Facebook, and Google News need to do to optimize their personalized ranking. On the one hand, we want to ensure that stories that are ranked higher are topically relevant for the user. On the other hand, Quora also has explicit connections between users. Actions on your “social network” should also influence the ranking. Finally, stories at Quora might sometimes relate to ongoing trending events. Timeliness is another element that should affect the model's decision to promote or demote a story.

Because of this, there are many different kinds of features that go into creating such a personalized rank at Quora. Let's list some of them:

 * Quality of the questions/answers
 * Topics the user is interested on
 * Other users the user is following
 * What is trending/popular
 * ...
As a matter of fact, it is important to keep in mind that at Quora we are interested in both engaging users to read interesting content and at presenting questions the users can write interesting content for. So, we have to include features that refer both to the interestingness of the answers as well as the questions. To derive those features, we use information derived from the actions done by the user, author, and object (i.e. answer/question). Those actions are considered and aggregated at different temporal windows and fed into the ranking algorithm. There are actually many different derived features that go into our personalized feed model, and we are constantly experimenting with adding more.

Another important consideration about our feed ranking application is that we need to be able to make it responsive to both user actions, impressions, and even trending events. We have an ever-growing collection of millions of questions and answers that we could not try to rank on real-time for a each user. In order to optimize the experience, we have implemented a multi-stage ranking solution where different candidates are selected and ranked in advanced before the final ranking is actually performed.

Recommendations

The personalized ranking described above is already a form of recommendation. A similar approach is used in different use cases. For example, the popular Quora email digest includes a collection of stories that have been selected and are recommended for you. This is a different learning-to-rank model that is optimized for a different objective function.

Besides ranking algorithms, we have other personalized recommendations that appear in different parts of the product. For example, in different places, you will see recommendations of people or topics you should follow (see below).

Related Questions

Another source of recommendations is giving users questions that are somewhat related to the current one.

Related questions are determined by using another machine learned model that takes into account different features that include, for example, textual similarity, co-visit data, or other shared features such as topics. Other features related to the popularity or quality of the question are also taking into account. It is important to note that what makes a good “similar” recommendation is not only how similar that item is to the source but the “interestingness” of the target. As a matter of fact, one of the trickiest issues for any “related items” machine learned model is how to tradeoff similarity vs. other relevance elements.

Related questions is a model that is particularly effective in creating engagement of logged out users when they visit the question page from an external search. That is one of the reasons why for now this recommendation model is unpersonalized.

Duplicates

Duplicate questions is an extreme case of the related questions case described above. This is an issue for Quora because we want to make sure that all energies from users answering a particular question are shared and focused in the right place. It is also important to point users who have a question and want to add it to the site to pre-existing answers. Because of this, a lot of efforts go into detecting duplicate questions, especially at creation time.

Our current solution is based on training a binary classifier trained with duplicate/non-duplicate labels. We use different kinds of signals that go from textual vector space models to usage-based features.

User Trust/Expertise Inference

In an application like Quora, it is important to understand how trustworthy a user is. As a matter of fact, we are not only interested in answering this question in an absolute way, but in relation to a given topic. A user might be very knowledgeable in some topics but not so much in others. At Quora we use ML techniques to infer user expertise. In order to train those models we have several important features. We not only know the answers a user has written in a given topic, but we also know the upvotes, downvotes, or views the user has received on those. We also know how many “endorsements” the user has on the given topic. Endorsements are an explicit acknowledgement on someone's expertise coming from other users.

The other important thing to keep in mind is that trust/expertise propagates through the network and that should be taken into account by the algorithms. For example, if I receive an upvote from an expert on Machine Learning to an answer on Machine Learning, this should count more than an upvote from a random user with no expertise on that topic. The same goes for endorsements and other user-to-user features.

Spam Detection and Moderation

A site like Quora that prides itself on maintaining a high quality threshold on the content has to be very vigilant on attempts to game the system by introducing spam, malicious, or simply very low quality content. A pure manual model to review content does not scale. The way to approach the problem, you guessed it, is to use ML models to detect these issues.

At Quora we have several models that detect different issues related to content quality. The output of those classifiers is in most cases not used directly to make a decision on the content but rather is used as a way to feed those questions/answers into moderation queues that are then manually reviewed.

Content Creation Prediction

A very important thing to keep in mind about Quora is the fact that we are optimizing many parts of the system not only to create an engaging experience for readers but also to maximize good quality and in-demand content being created. For this reason, we have a ML model that predicts the probability of a user writing an answer to a given question. This allows our system to prioritize those questions in different ways. One of them is the system's automatic A2A (Ask to Answer) that sends these questions to potential writers through notifications. Other ranking systems explained above will also use this predicted probability.

Models

Quora has tried many different models to address the different use cases described above. Sometimes we use open source implementations, but many others we end up implementing more efficient or flexible in-house versions.

I won't go into the details of what model is used where, but here is a list of models that are used in different places of our system:

 * Logistic Regression
 * Elastic Nets
 * Gradient Boosted Decision Trees
 * Random Forests
 * Neural Networks
 * LambdaMART
 * Matrix Factorization
 * Vector models and other NLP techniques
 * ...
Conclusion

As described above, Quora uses Machine Learning in many different ways. While we have already been able to get very important gains by using these ML approaches, we feel confident that there are many more gains to be had and we continue investing in new techniques. Besides, there are exciting new applications of ML in the near future that we are already starting to think about. These include areas such as ad ranking, machine translation, and other applications of NLP that will directly feed into new product features we plan on adding soon.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-questions-about-machine-learning-asked-on-Quora?top_ans=11003919,2015-04-02T00:32:49.836483+00:00,2017-02-23T04:58:12.622852+00:00,1598,Xavier Amatriain,https://www.quora.com/profile/Xavier-Amatriain

It's kinda easy to tell which are human and which are computers as the AI questions are pretty nonsensical.

How is machine learning patterned through asking questions?,"It is “patterned” (I think you mean “trained”) with a combination of statistics and calculus. Statistics is used to collect information about how some phenomenon in reality behaves, and calculus is used to derive a formula of that behavior. It is the process of repeatedly performing statistics on the phenomenon‘s data, generating a formula with calculus, then measuring the error of that formula against the phenomenon‘s data and finally the incorporation of that error back into the statistics and repeating this entire process that is the machine learning / algorithm training process.

This initial machine learning / algorithm training process may be augmented afterwards with what is called RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). That is where the freshly trained AI is “asked questions” - basically tested for accuracy. If the AI gives incorrect answers that “question and answer” are marked for inclusion in a near future training data set - a training at the tail end of this human asking questions period.

Note that only a subset of AIs operate with human language, and those that do have an additional aspect of their RLHF, and that is a layer of ethical consideration where the AI is enhanced to look at the given question and compare the body of knowledge the question requires with basic human ethics. If the question’s area of knowledge lies within an ethically questionable region, the AI is trained to not respond, or respond with a canned denial to answer.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-questions-about-machine-learning-asked-on-Quora?top_ans=1477743684703367,2023-08-02T18:59:05.828596+00:00,2023-08-02T18:59:36.630411+00:00,1,Blake Senftner,https://www.quora.com/profile/Blake-Senftner

"Can we build AI with all the questions contained on Quora? If so, how?","The problem is the definition of the term ""AI"". 

If you mean: could we, using Quora, build a system that helps to answer questions that people have about the world around them? 

The answer is yes. We could apply a Watson-style natural language processing engine on top of a question you could type in. In a sense it wouldn't be that different from, say, Wolfram Alpha. 

If you mean: could we, using Quora, build a system that truly ""understands"" the world, and is able to make deductions and reason about the way things are and function as an entity that makes decisions based on its environment -- i.e., what most people really mean when they say AI? 

Then the answer is: probably not in the foreseeable future. A project called Cyc (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc) took a much more carefully built data set -- approximately 1 million pure logical statements, trying to achieve something like sentient AI. That project has been going for 27 years (it was started in 1984) and to put it bluntly, the results have been modest.

What are interesting topics in machine learning?,"Machine learning is the subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with making computers able to automatically learn from data, instead of being explicitly programmed. Applications are numerous and include email spam filters, search engines, fraud detection systems, self-driving cars etc.

Machine learning can be divided into supervised learning (you have a training set that includes both inputs and outputs) and unsupervised learning (you only have inputs and you want to discover patterns in them).

it's an amazing field of research that has given us self-driving cars, new ways to treat cancer, the discovery of new planets and much more.

some interesting topics in machine learning:

- Neural Networks (a breakthrough occurred recently thanks to something called ""Long Short Term Memory Units"")

- Recommender Systems or ""How do you make people who read articles on the web, buy products online?""

- How would I build a self driving car? (Computer vision and deep learning)

"How would you recommend to study machine learning (book, courses, etc.)?","In general, questions of the form “how would you recommend to study X”, whether X be physics, ML, baking, or knitting, are challenging to answer because the answer depends on a quality that psychologists call “intrinsic motivation”.

IM is defined as the act of doing of something purely for the pleasure of doing it, rather than doing it for some external reward. Experiments with monkeys about 50 years ago revealed that they would play endlessly with some mechanical puzzles thrown into their cages, despite the fact that doing so earned them no brownie points with their caretakers — no extra bananas or other rewards were provided, and yet the monkeys persisted in this seemingly pointless activity.

I began the study of ML almost four decades ago in 1982, almost entirely by accident. I was training to be an electrical engineer, as I liked the combination of elegant math — information theory, Maxwell’s equations, quantum theory of transistors — and practical impact of EE in the fast expanding world of digital technology of the early 1980s. I discovered an entirely new universe of ideas in Douglas Hofstadter’s breakthrough book Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, a once in a generation type book that earned its first time author the prestigious Pulitzer prize in nonfiction. After devouring the 800 odd pages of GEB — remember, this was not required reading for my EE courses in grad school — I convinced my mentors at IIT Kanpur to let me reorient my entire MS grad program towards AI and ML.

Looking back on my decision, it seems almost a foolhardy move to have made in 1982. Why would I turn my back on an established EE engineering field with guaranteed employment and job security in favor of a new fangled field called “machine learning”, which then in India and even in the US was barely a term that registered to any would be employer. Doing ML or AI in the early 1980s was a good way to become unemployable. But, somehow, I made this fateful decision, and never regretted this apparently risky and downright foolish decision to study AI, when it was in its infancy.

Of course, being an early entrant into the field does come with its eventual rewards, and I have spent a fun-filled 35 years, mostly as an academic writing over 150 papers in ML and AI. The risk taking nature that I exhibited in 1982 didn't change when I got my first job at IBM Research in 1990. Once again, IBM in 1990 had no clue what to do with a “machine learning” PhD, and threw me in with a newly formed robotics group (I had of course no knowledge of robotics). But, I discovered the very nascent field of reinforcement learning, and once again, threw all caution to the wind and explored the use of RL to train robots, now 25 years later, a field that has become much more popular. My 1992 Artificial Intelligence journal paper on using Q-learning to train mobile robots remains one my top cited articles:

ScienceDirect [ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0004370292900586 ]

The reason for this long prelude is that in 2018, machine learning (and AI) are far different fields than they were back in the early 1980s. What was then a foolish decision now seems entirely rational and predictable. Of course, anyone would choose to study ML or AI now, when it promises endless employment potential and a highly bankable CV. So, this gets me to finally addressing your question:

1. Are you seeking to study ML so you can transition from your current career, whatever it is, to becoming a data scientist?
2. Are you, instead, intrinsically motivated to learn ML, not because you seek to financially profit from your studies, but rather because you are just curious about the field?
3. Are you, finally, seeking to delve into some exciting field of research, perhaps become a trailblazer in some new emerging technology or scientific field?
Depending on the answers you give for each of these questions, the approach to studying ML may be entirely different. If, for example, you want to quickly become proficient in some data science skills, say Python, R, or Tensor Flow/Pytorch, then there are any number of online courses and tutorials that can help you get up to speed. Of course, be aware that in this case, you are going to be in competition with several million other people who all have the same idea, and whose CVs come flooding through our email inboxes each and every day. So, it’s a good idea to learn some data science skills, but be aware of it may not immediately lead to the dream job that you were hoping to get.

If you are, instead, intrinsically motivated to learn ML, then, my congratulations to you! You can begin, as I did, with some interesting puzzle, and see how to solve it. Why, you can study the same exact problem I did way back in 1982, and see if modern deep learning can solve the classic “Bongard Problems”, simple pattern recognition puzzles that can be very easy to solve (for humans), or fiendishly difficult, depending on the problem. Solve a few Bongard problems listed here, and see how well you do:

You see listed above on the left a set of geometric shapes, and an equal-sized but different set of shapes on the right. What’s the rule that separates all the shapes on the left from that on the right? It’s a simple geometric property, one that turns out to be very important in the theory of machine learning, incidentally.

OK, you were able to quickly solve the above problem. How about this one below?

Here is an interesting Quanta article on Bongard problems:

Bongard Problems and Scientific Discovery [ https://www.quantamagazine.org/bongard-problems-and-scientific-discovery-20170608/ ]

Well, I did my M.S. thesis at the Indian Institute of Technology in 1983 (spring semester), on a machine learning system to solve the Bongard problems, working all night on a clunky huge Digital Equipment Corporation DEC-10 computer using an arcane language popular in AI then called LISP. I worked at night, because the terminals were all busy during the day. So each night, from 10 p.m., till about 4 a.m. in the morning, I wrote code that tried to solve the problems. That was the way I learned to do ML. You can do this as well today, with the far more powerful computers and GPU machines accessible today (probably a million times faster than the old Dec-10 I used).

36 years later, I would be surprised if someone managed to solve the Bongard problems with today’s ML technology. They are fiendishly hard, and remember, you have only 6 examples of each class. You can’t do the au courant NIPS (NeurIPS) style MNIST cheat of assuming that each class has 10,000 or 100,000 examples. Sorry, 6 is all you get. Hey, 2 year old kids learn the concept of a “dog” from one or two examples. The patterns are also endless. It’s not just 10 categories of digits, or a few thousand objects, like Imagenet. Good luck!

Finally, if you are the third sort of person, looking for a new exciting field, one that is in its nascent state, then I would not recommend ML. It’s far too mature a technology, far too well established, with millions of prospective entrants and a lot of competition. The most recent ML conference sold out its registration in under 10 minutes! So, what should you do?

Well, you could do something like what I have started to do. I have begun exploring an entirely new field, one I call “imagination science”, which tries to understand this mysterious ability that humans have called “imagination”. If you do a web search of this term, you will not find any significant papers on it in the AI or ML conferences. I am giving a tutorial on imagination machines at the next AAAI conference in Hawaii in 2019 (January end). I’m pleased to say there is, to my knowledge, not one accepted paper at AAAI on imagination. That’s exactly why I picked this subject. It’s one that is hugely important to all the scientific and technological progress that man has made over the past 5 or more centuries, and yet, remains almost entirely unexplored.

Once again, I must caution you that studying imagination is no guarantee of job employment. In the Bay Area or elsewhere, tech companies are not falling over themselves trying to recruit “imagination science” researchers or engineers (as they are trying to hire ML folks now). So, it’s a risky business, but heck, you live life once (I say this even though I am a Hindu, and we are supposed to believe in reincarnation). What’s the point of living, unless one takes a few risks?

So, there you have it. My three answers to studying ML, or in fact, not studying ML, depending on your motivation. On this Christmas morning of 2018, may this answer help you in some small way to achieve your dreams!",https://www.quora.com/Which-book-is-best-for-practicing-machine-learning-problems-with-case-studies?top_ans=114221049,2018-12-25T17:39:17.050588+00:00,2018-12-25T17:44:40.602498+00:00,391,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
Which are the top 3 books that you would recommend in Machine Learning?,"Warning: this answer is overly long! Apologies and feel free to skip if you are one of those who wants a Twitter style 140 character answer.

By and large, and I don’t mean to offend anyone, I don't like any of the textbooks in machine learning. For 15 years, I taught the fall introductory course in machine learning for graduate students at UMass, Amherst. It was a wonderful way to keep current in the field, as well as to shore up one’s basic foundations in math, statistics, and optimization. Sadly, I found none of the current books do justice to the breadth of topics that constitutes modern machine learning. For example, I find it sacrilegious that all the texts avoid any mention of reinforcement learning. Really? I mean, how far can one get in building AI learning systems without RL? Unless you believe that when you began to learn as a baby, your parents kept around large stashes of labeled training data for you to pore over every day. Hmmm.. good luck with that. Strike one!

The second problem is that most books begin by essentially giving you in chapter 1, a dictionary of probability distributions to essentially “memorize”. If there’s a worse way to teach machine learning, I don’t know what that would be. As the work on deep learning should convince everyone, one can get very far in machine learning without having to explicitly appeal to machinations involving the multivariate normal distribution or the exponential family. While no one doubts the value of probability distributions, they don’t have to introduced at the beginning. Strike two!

Finally, most of the standard books do a relatively poor job of explaining basic ideas in statistics. Take the classic EM algorithm. Every book in ML that I know introduces EM in the context of relatively complex problems, like mixture models or HMMs. This is in fact not the way EM was developed in statistics, but it was developed for much simpler problems where the basic intuition of EM is much easier to grasp (e.g., assume you can observe only 90% of the samples from a 1-dimensional Gaussian (normal distribution) with unknown mean and variance, and 10% of the samples are “missing”. What do you do? It’s quite easy to think of beginning with a simple idea like filling in an initial mean for all unobserved samples, and writing out a recurrence relation. One can easily show this EM method converges to maximize observed data likelihood. ). Books on EM in statistics are far better at explaining the full richness of EM. Strike three!

So, how is one to cope in the interim, while we wait for someone to write the ideal ML textbook (which doesn't suffer the three gotchas above). Learning machine learning can be analogized to a travel vacation, where you have 3 months to learn about a foreign destination, say Europe. So, where do you go, and how much time do you spend in each place? You could spend all 3 months in London or Paris, but that would not teach you what Europe is (this is essentially what a lot of ML textbooks currently do, they focus on the one topic that the author(s) happen to expert at). You could sign up for one of these crazy guided tours, which takes you to a new city every other day. You would certainly see a lot of Europe this way, but you would be exhausted at the end of it, and probably not remember very much (and most of your time would be inside a bus or a train).

So, some compromise between breadth and depth is obviously called for. First, understand what the broad scope of machine learning is. It includes many fields, ranging from supervised learning (the most well studied, and as far as biology goes, the most unnatural and implausible approach), to unsupervised learning (extremely important in biology as well as ML), and reinforcement learning (hugely important in biology, well studied in ML, ignored by ML textbook writers). Before learning ML methods, and I can't emphasize this enough, learn the ML problem formulations! Einstein was once asked what he would do if he had one hour to live, and was told his life depended on solving some problem. He said he would take 55 minutes to understand the problem and ask the right question(s). In the remaining 5 minutes, he would spend solving the problem. This is a good lesson to keep in mind. Far too many students of ML get obsessed over methods. Realize that methods change all the time. Problems rarely change. Far better to learn things that don’t change first than obsess over things that change every month or year.

My approach gradually evolved to become what was exactly the opposite of modern textbook writers. I began with unsupervised learning, because I consider this the foundation of all biological and machine learning. In the beginning, when you are born, and are barely functional (except bawling), labels make little sense. Your parents can whisper sweet nothings in your ears, and attach labels to objects all they can, but devoid of language and meaning, these make no sense to you. Clearly, this is the crucial stage where basic representations get learned (and there is a lot of neuroscience to back this up). So, learning representations is the basic problem. Start by learning the simplest methods, like principal components analysis (PCA), and canonical correlational analysis (CCA) for multiple datasets. Progress to more sophisticated methods that exploit the geometry of the data space, such as manifold learning methods (e..g, Laplacian eigenmaps). The need for a good dose of basic math (linear algebra) will become quickly clear to you. Some basic neural implementations of methods like PCA will be helpful in seeing how to turn batch type methods into incremental gradient type methods.

Once unsupervised learning methods are broadly understood, progress to reinforcement learning. This is the stage where babies begin to crawl around, learning to walk, and simple behaviors are mastered (picking up objects, still with no sense of what they are called or what “language” is). A good understanding of basic reinforcement learning will help also make the connection between machine learning and AI, robotics, and control theory. Sutton and Barto’s textbook on RL should be on everyone’s reading list. Eminently readable and highly engaging. A new edition is in the works and should be coming out soon.

Finally, supervised learning can be studied, and there are of course a zillion methods and approaches, all clamoring to be heard. How to make sense of them all? A golden rule is that by and large, the simpler the method, the more longer lasting it will be, and the wider it will be used. Everyone should learn and master linear models of classification and regression, and linear models are by far still the most widely used models in science. Why? Because they are interpretable and understandable. Scientists care about explainability ultimately, not accuracy.

I can’t resist quoting the great Nobel-prizewinning economist Ronald Coase, who till recently taught at the University of Chicago (one of the best economics departments in the world). He said, and I quote:

“•A theory is not like an airline or bus timetable. We are not interested simply in the accuracy of its predictions. A theory also serves as a base for thinking. It helps us to understand what is going on by enabling us to organize our thoughts.

•Faced with a choice between a theory which predicts well but gives us little insight into how the system works and one which gives us this insight but predicts badly, I would choose the latter, and I am inclined to think that most economists would do the same.”

This is in a nutshell, the central quandary in modern machine learning. The best methods in terms of experimental performance on artificial datasets, come from deep learning. Unfortunately, these are the very methods we understand the least, and are essentially opaque. Linear models, on the other hand, are extremely well understood, and very explainable. But, they don’t perform as well as deep learning methods. So, textbook writers face an additional quandary. They can cover the latest methods, but give up any hope of providing a rich theory and comprehensibility, or they can focus on simple linear models, provide a comprehensive theory and stress on explainability, but ignore the fact that the methods covered are not going to be the ones that win some “bake off” artificial competition. Coase says clearly what side of this debate he would choose.

So, is there a “best” among the bad choices we do have? If forced to pick one book, I would choose “Learning from Data” by Abu-Mostafa and colleagues. It wisely sticks to things we understand well and can analyze well: linear models. It gives a great introduction to computational learning theory. It clearly explains basic concepts like overfitting. And finally, it does not “snow” you with probability distributions. Best of all, it is short and inexpensive.

Learning From Data - A Short Course [ http://amlbook.com ]

My second choice would have to be Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto’s timeless classic on reinforcement learning. Full of insight, and highly readable. It sets the standard by which all ML textbooks should be judged. Again, it is relatively short, relatively inexpensive, and a new edition is coming out soon….

Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning): Richard S. Sutton, Andrew G. Barto: 9780262193986: Amazon.com: Books [ https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation/dp/0262193981 ]

Which leaves one final book to recommend on the requested three books on ML shortlist. For this last choice, I would not pick an ML textbook, but rather something that nicely complements the above two choices. The central concept in statistics that ML students should learn is likelihood functions. If there is ONE idea everyone in ML should learn, it is why statistics does not equal probability. In my beginning lecture, I always ask students to tell me how statistics is different from probability theory. No one invariably gets this right. So, to understand this, I highly recommend this gem of a book called “In All Likelihood”.

Amazon.com: In All Likelihood: Statistical Modelling and Inference Using Likelihood (9780199671229): Yudi Pawitan: Books [ https://www.amazon.com/All-Likelihood-Statistical-Modelling-Inference/dp/0199671222/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1500837166&sr=1-1&keywords=in+all+likelihood ]

Yudi Pawitan’s book is a gem, and uses many examples, most of them simple, to communicate the essence of likelihood functions. This is the one concept in statistics that separates it from probability theory, and it is central to machine learning. Again, a relatively cheap book, and very short in length!

There you have it! All these three books are 1) short 2) inexpensive as textbooks go 3) very well written and have great reviews on Amazon.

Whatever course you take to learn about “machine learning”, I envy you. This is an unforgettable experience, and my own journey began more than 35 years ago, when I discovered the book “Godel, Escher, Bach” by Douglas Hofstadter. It opened up a whole new world for me, one that I have spent most of my life happily exploring the ML problem. These days, I’m more interested in another topic, but this message is already getting too long, so that will remain for another day!",https://www.quora.com/Which-book-is-best-for-practicing-machine-learning-problems-with-case-studies?top_ans=51308784,2017-07-23T18:58:08.566410+00:00,2019-01-10T03:30:07.264532+00:00,279,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6

If you mean learning the methods, I'd suggest ESL.

What are some good books on machine learning?,"This answer attempts the very ambitious problem of producing an approximately complete list. Please leave comments and tell me what's wrong and/or what is missing -- right now it's a pretty small list so I've surely left something off.

Introductory remarks
I think of most of ML as a contribution to the question of how we can perform statistical inference. So I will attempt to describe these books in terms of how they approach this problem (e.g., whether they are theoretical or practical, frequentist or Bayesian, and so on). Some of them will not be about ML per se, but will be about subjects on which ML people depend greatly. Generally I judge this based on whether you could publish something about it at a conference like NIPS or ICML, or whether ML people are likely to make up a significant amount of the audience when talks are delivered on the subject.



In no particular order:


Foundations of Machine Learning, Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh, Ameet Talwalkar [ http://www.amazon.com/dp/026201825X ]
An ambitious book that covers an impressive subset of the theoretical basis of machine learning. Includes excellent treatment of fundamentals (learning complexity, kernel methods, boosting, PAC learning, regression), as well as some subects that are almost never covered properly (ranking, multiclass, online). Additionally gives a nice ML perspective of some things (JL-lemma) that usually are not talked about well in textbooks.

Learning From Data, Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Hsuan-Tien Lin [ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600490069 ]
Sort of like Foundations of Machine Learning, but seems to be built for an undergrad curriculum. Contains stuff about the theoretical underpinnings, but omits the more complicated theory. It is well-written and intuitive, with theoretically intense parts clearly marked and roped off for those who are, e.g., too mathematically ""young.""

Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms, David J. C. MacKay [ http://www.amazon.com/Information-Theory-Inference-Learning-Algorithms/dp/0521642981 ] [free pdf [ http://free pdf ]]
A presentation of statistical modeling that is unified across information theory, coding theory, statistics, physics, ML, computational biology, cryptography, and signal processing. It is fantastically and uniquely illuminating. Contains my favorite treatment of many subjects (Ising models, Monte Carlo methods, fountaint codes, etc.).

All of Statistics, Larry Wasserman [ http://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/0387402721 ]
Most of ML is collected into a series of tasks (regression, classification, clustering, etc.) whose only commonality is that they are types of statistical inference. Among the virtues of this remarkable book is that it approaches the subject of statistical inference in a very general fashion, and in a way that is graceful and approachable, but still rigorous. This is a good starting point for ML, as most of ML is a specialization of some subset of the topics presented here. IMO, it is the best book of its type.

Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, Kevin P. Murphy [ http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262018020 ]
Mostly a roundup of the recent explosion in Bayesian inference. Unlike other books on this list, ML:APP seems to have been assembled by collecting papers, stapling them all together, making the notation consistent, and adding a bit of glue to unify them. For example, most of the figures are pulled (with permission) directly from other papers. This is not a bad thing! I'm very glad someone did it. But it does sometimes feel rushed, and there are many typos.

Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Christopher M. Bishop [ http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738 ]
Bishop's book is useful mainly because it is quite thorough, and contains a good treatment of many of the esoteric corners of well-known methods. But I also found it to be quite dense, and often didn't understand exactly what Bishop was saying, or how he derived something. I find that it is very useful when I consult it about a subject after having already read 2 or 3 other texts.

The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman [ http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576 ] [pdf [ http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/ ]]
The quintessential (frequentist) ML text. It's more computationally-minded than I would have expected from classically trained statisticians, but its lack of robustly Bayesian material dates it in some ways. (I'm not saying one perspective is better, I'm saing you should know both.

Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques, Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman [ http://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Principles-Computation/dp/0262013193 ]
A dense, comprehensive, and canonical treatment of graphical models. Covers Markov Random Fields, Contitional Random fields, Bayes nets, and so on.

Gaussian Processes For Machine Learning, Carl Edward Rasmussen, Christopher K. I. Williams [ http://www.amazon.com/Gaussian-Processes-Learning-Adaptive-Computation/dp/026218253X ] [free pdf [ http://free pdf ]]
The classical treatment of the Gaussian process, an important class of statistical model.

Which books are best for beginner in machine learning?,"It is hard to answer this question especially since I don't have any clue about your background. So, I will give you my background when I started with machine learning. I was a core engineer with little to zero knowledge in linear algebra, probability and optimization (note that I did learn probability, linear algebra, and optimization as part of my school and engineering coursework but they lacked the necessary rigour which would translate into learning ML). Having this background, this is how my ML learning route went:
1. I started with Neural Network by Raul Rojas during my Bachelors [A]. Although, the title says, ""A Systematic Introduction"", it is hardly a systematic introduction. On the other hand, however, it gives sufficient details about the algorithm - enough to be able to implement the neural network on your own which is exactly what I did. My bachelor's final year project was to implement a Neural Network Simulator where I implemented 5 popular neural network all with a GUI etc. Another book that I came across much later and which you might prefer is [B].
2. When I was doing my Master's, I did RA in an NLP group for a brief time, during which I had implemented Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi algorithm. The reference I had used at the time was [C].
3. During my Master's, I did a course in ""Learning with Kernels"" (Department of Computer Science and Engineering [ http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/teaching/courses/CS678.html ]). Our primary reference was [D]. This was the first book that taught me SVM - primals and duals and it actually gives a pseudocode for SMO algorithm for training SVMs. So, I went ahead and implemented the SMO algorithm (that is my own SVM) just for fun.
4. As part of my Master's thesis, I had to implement Online Support Vector Regression [E].
5. When I joined Yahoo! Research Lab as a Research Engineer, I was working with an amazing researcher along with whom I was implementing a graphical model for the first time. I had to write competing algorithms, so I also implemented HITS Algorithm [F] and TruthFinder [G].
6. Later on, I worked on a model, that was similar in spirit to [H], so I implemented [H] as well so as to understand the model better. Working on this further, later lead to our paper in WSDM 2011.

7. When I joined my PhD, I did a course in ""Convex Optimization"" ( http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/saketh/teaching/cs709.html ). Our primary reference was [I]. At the end of the course, we had to do a course project, so we implemented cutting plane based Multiple Kernel Learning from this [J] paper. Thanks to that, I was able to utilize the MKL strategy and cutting plane technique in my recent ICML 2014 work.
The point I am trying to distinctly drive here is the fact that most of my learning has come by implementing stuff. I had nobody to tell me which books to follow and at the time, the internet did not have the kind of resources that it has today. I just picked different things and I just started implementing it. I would fail at times and succeed at times. However, the knowledge I gained during those times cannot be compared to anything. The knowledge from books augmented those experiences and enhanced my understanding even further.

So, my personal suggestion is to pick up any book, be it PRML by Chris Bishop or Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell or Andrew Ng's excellent online videos or this amazing online video course [K] by Prof. Yasser Abu-Mostafa, just go ahead and implement whatever you can or whatever you want to. There is abundance of resource out there.

I want to learn artificial intelligence and machine learning. Where can I start?,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning will be here for the long term. The majority of industry verticals harness AI and ML to create multiple job opportunities and a better future.

Recent innovations such as intelligent voice assistants and self-driving vehicles, robotic process automation, and so on have helped ML and AI gain traction. This has taken the world by storm, and everyone is eager to learn more about it.

AI and ML are in constant change and evolving daily. A few universities offer a formal degree, but you can achieve it in many other ways.

I have compiled the most effective ways to learn AI/Machine Learning after extensive research.


%3E My best tip for learning AI and machine learning is to follow a 5-step process.
Step 1:

 * Change your mindset. You can apply machine learning and AI to your everyday life.

 * Work on AI and Machine Learning Problems That Matter To You
Step 5:

 * Create a PortfolioDo it. Gather information and show your abilities.
 * Build a very own standardised Portfolio
 * Get Paid by Applying for an appropriate job
 * Start and maintain a good career with great achievements and make AI and Machine Learning For Money.

%3E You can learn through E-books.
The best and most traditional way to learn about any field is through books, especially AI and ML.

Many e-books are available such as Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. However, if you want to learn how to create AI, this book is a must-read. The book was written by AI experts Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig. This book covers all aspects of Artificial Intelligence from A to Z, including first-order logic, reinforcement and learning, and neural networks.


%3E Possible with Blogs and Websites
Some many blogs and websites deal with Data Science. Blogs and websites are one of the best learning tools. They also provide many practical skills and experience.

Kdnuggets and Kaggle are some of the most visited blogs and websites. Reddit and Google News on Data Science are two examples of important news sources related to data science.


%3E You can even learn AI and Machine learning through the online platforms
Online courses are the best way to learn AI.

Let's look at some resources that will teach you how to master AI and Machine Learning.

 * HackerEarth
How do you start learning AI/ML? HackerEarth is an excellent online resource for engineers and developers who are just starting to learn these technologies. This site offers many blogs and product guides that discuss how to learn AI, Machine Learning.

 * Google Machine Learning
Google's ""Introduction to Machine Learning Problem Framing"" online course is another interesting resource. It is a 1-hour-long course that helps you to frame and solve problems with Machine Learning. You will be able to build your data and train your ML model. If you are just starting, you will need to learn everything from the most basic concepts to advanced algorithms. The third option might be a good choice.

 * Online courses in Python
Learning Python programming is a great way to get started if you don't have any programming experience. Data Science with Python is another option. It allows you to create and implement popular Predictive Analytics algorithms such as Forecasting and Regression. Also, classification and segmentation ML algorithms such as Random Forest and K Means using Python. This is a great option for beginners who are interested in Data Science.

Learning through Courses/Institutes. I recommend that you first build a solid foundation in your technical skills before moving on to a course. This is why I recommend it:

A. Although you can certainly learn from free materials online, they do not have a structured curriculum. As a result, it is possible to waste time learning a concept, only to find out later that it wasn't so important.

B. Invest in your time, not in saving money. Imagine investing in courses to save one year.

C. Many Indians have the mentality that why spend money on a course. Why not? Instead of being stuck in a rut, why not take a course? You will reap the benefits if you do it.

You can find courses at some great institutes that I recommend, and you can certainly try them if they suit your goals.


%3E You can find courses at some great institutes that I recommend, and you can certainly try them if they suit your goals.
Some top institutes/courses can be used to achieve great heights.

 * Learnbay
 * Coursera
 * Udemy
A. Learnbay: Advance AI and ML Certification Program in Collaboration with IBM

I highly recommend this data science course for working professionals with more than 4 years of experience and planning an ML and AI career within an upcoming couple of years.

The key reason for such recommendation is Learnbay's domain expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning training. Therefore, instead of dumping everyone into the same course, Learnbay offers you the scopes of choosing the elective modules per your industry experience. Below are a few of such domains.

 * Oil and gas industry: Here, you learn AI-powered data-oriented practices of high-performance machines, oil drilling activity, power outage advantage identification and automated solution at the very early stage, etc.
 * Media communication and transportation industry: Here, you learn deep learning associated solutions for customer segmentation, identification, client satisfaction management, security management, regional market studies, etc.
 * Mechanical and production industry: Here, you learn the advanced application of Big Data analytics and different machine learning algorithm types to make the production process more agile. You also get to know the core of data-driven fabrication design with solid works.
 * Telecommunication industry: Here, you learn the machine learning implemented network quality management and less manpower associated but more accurate teleco's extracting values as well as strategic outputs.
 * Supply chain industry: here, you learn the advanced application of AI and ML in stakeholder network analysis, logistic management, NLP and text analytical application for better customer supports, etc.,
 * Banking and finance: Here, you get to know the process of automated banking and financial deal management, card related fraud detection, NLP associated self-run recommendation systems, etc.
Technical background candidate can choose a second elective domain from core engineering like

 * System designing and data structure
 * Cloud computation
 * IoT and automation.
Other than that, you get

 * 24*7 tech support.
 * From reviewing your resume/profile to deciding which course to enrol in.
 * You can also join another batch if you cannot attend a particular batch. Thus, there is no chapter you will miss. Furthermore, you even get a 2 years subscription so that even after you complete the course, you can attend any live and interactive classes for more than 1 year. This is an excellent feature that Learnbay has added to my experience.
 * They can also refer you and assist in your selection for an amazing job with AI.
 * Their Course Fee is another reason. It's very affordable and can be incorporated into any budget. The particular AI and ML course cost 79,000 INR.
 * The courses have the main advantage of allowing you to work with real-world data science projects.
 * You will also be working on 16+ real-world projects and two capstone projects. This allows you to put all your learnings into practice under one roof.
 * Course Duration is 9 months.
Overall, it's a great platform to promote your interest in AI but preferably for experienced pros. For less experienced candidates and freshmen, below are the two alternative options.

B. Coursera:

Andrew Ng Coursera recorded tutorials video-based to complete this extremely reliable AI course.

This course is designed to teach you how Machine Learning works.

This is why I can't stress enough how this course is best suited to theoretical learning. You will also need to practice the course to reap its learning benefits.

This course is recommended for beginners to learn about AI and ML. The theory behind these concepts will be clear to you. This book will give you a lot of knowledge.

C. Udemy:

Udemy courses should be taken at least once. You will be given a brief introduction to AI.

This brief overview will give you an idea of how AI works with real-world data. Along with deep learning theory, you will see how AI can be applied in real life. You will learn how computers can improve every day without human intervention. You will also learn about self-driving cars.

Udemy is a well-known brand that has been around for many years. So you can trust their high-quality courses.

I recommend that you continue with self-learning. Then, once you feel confident, you can enrol in a course to help you get to know more.

Additional Bonus Tips:

Join AI and ML communities on LinkedIn, Telegram, etc. Networking with others is a great way to practice. You will be motivated to work harder if you see others putting in an effort. Happy Learning!

Which are the best books to get the Math background for Machine Learning?,"Mathematics for Machine Learning by Marc Peter Deisenroth et al. is probably the best and most comprehensive book that is specifically dedicated to math for machine learning.

Unless you already have some significant math background, it is a tough read though. I suggest to use the book as a guide. If you don’t understand something from the book alone, look for the videos on the topic on Khan academy. They break complex math down quite nicely. The authors of the book have also published a Coursera course under the same name, which is more accessible.",https://www.quora.com/Which-book-is-best-for-practicing-machine-learning-problems-with-case-studies?top_ans=255872877,2020-12-22T19:11:21.137879+00:00,,7,Sebastian Kirsch,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sebastian-Kirsch-2

What is the best algorithm book for a beginner in machine learning?,"I recommend Learning From Data (LDA) by Yaser Abu-Mostafa. I tutored for the Machine Learning class at my university and later worked as a TA for the class, and this is the book we used. More concretely, out of 153 reviews on Amazon, ~78% of reviewers gave it 5 stars. It’s an amazing book.

Why is this a great book to start your machine learning journey? Basically it is a simultaneously accessible, deep, and concise (~200 pages) discussion of the fundamentals of machine learning. It covers the ideas and concepts that are applicable to every machine learning algorithm from neural nets to random forests. While there are plenty of ml books out there, LDA is the one book I’ve seen that covers this material at a reasonably deep level in an accessible, concise way.

To elaborate, note that you can view the body of knowledge that is “machine learning” as two chunks of information. One chunk consists of a set of specific algorithms. These algorithms are characterized by their ability to “learn”, meaning that they improve at what they do from experience aka seeing more data. Examples include random forests, support vector machines, KNN, linear models, neural nets, etc.

The second chunk consists of concepts that underly all of those algorithms - concepts that let you understand why the algorithms work (or don’t work), how to make them better, how to evaluate them, etc. Examples include overfitting, bagging, boosting, regularization, VC dimension (lets you prove that learning is possible), bias-variance tradeoff, cross validation etc.

LDA is fantastic in that it provides a concise yet deep coverage of the “underlying concepts” chunk of information.

Here is an example to illustrate why this is so important. Imagine you want to predict the price of a house given info like total square footage, number of rooms, etc. You start off with a dataset describing 10,000 houses. This data contains the actual prices of these houses along with the “predictor” variables total square footage, number of rooms, etc. You use this data to “train” (aka create) a machine learning algorithm that can take in predictor variables and return a predicted price. Note, the process of training the algorithm depends on the specific algo you use - different ml algorithms are trained in different ways (neural nets use back propagation, stochastic gradient descent with logistic regression, etc.).

After you have your algorithm, you want to evaluate how well it works. To start, you select a house from your initial dataset (the data you used to train the algorithm). You feed its predictors into the algorithm and a predicted price is returned. You are happy to see the prediction is close to the true price. You try this a few more times and continue to observe that the predictions are close to the true values.

Next you say, ok that’s great. I wonder how well the algorithm will predict prices of houses that weren’t in the dataset used to train the algorithm. This is key, because the algorithm would be almost useless if it could only predict the prices of houses in our original dataset; we already know the prices of those houses. We want to predict the prices of other houses.

So we get some new housing data. This data has prices and the same predictor variables as our original dataset. But our algorithm hasn’t “seen” this data meaning that the data wasn’t used to train the algorithm. We feed this data into the algorithm and to our dismay, the predictions it returns are really bad - they are very different from the true prices. It looks like we can’t use this algorithm to predict housing prices with any reasonable degree of confidence.

Now this is where LDA comes in. LDA covers this specific problem which is referred to as “overfitting”. It explains where overfitting comes from and how this is one of the core problems of machine learning that practitioners deal with all the time. Further, LDA explains techniques such as regularization, bagging, boosting, etc. that can likely improve the model’s ability to make predictions. Further, LDA covers how you can quantify how confident you should be in your model’s predictions after you improve it.

All to say, LDA - in 200 pages - covers those core principles that guide you as you develop you models.

Best of luck, I hope this post helps you on your way!",https://www.quora.com/Which-book-is-best-for-practicing-machine-learning-problems-with-case-studies?top_ans=159177481,2019-08-06T18:40:53.264917+00:00,2019-09-10T18:56:30.998702+00:00,1,Jack Grundy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Grundy-4
What are some good books/papers for learning deep learning?,"I am writing a new book on deep learning, with +Ian Goodfellow and +Aaron Courville. Draft chapters will soon be made available for feedback. Early versions are already at http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/dlbook",https://www.quora.com/Which-book-is-best-for-practicing-machine-learning-problems-with-case-studies?top_ans=5300089,2014-05-27T13:35:31.568000+00:00,,677,Yoshua Bengio,https://www.quora.com/profile/Yoshua-Bengio
Practical advice for machine learning?,"Machine Learning is basically trying to find a function which closely models your data. So, say you have one attribute(data) and your data is in the form (x,y) and looks like (2,6), (3,9), (5,15), (1,3) ... where x is the attribute and y is the target. Just by looking at the data you can understand that your data follows a relation Y = 3X (Y is dependent and X is dependent). This is of course a naive case and in real life, the function is not so easy to learn. Unlike the linear relationship, we have complex polynomial and even exponential relationships. And that is why we apply machine learning algorithms to understand how do we build a model (function) from existing data which can predict any new data.

Occam's razor works everywhere. So if your data is simple, simpler techniques are better. If its complex, complex are better. Also, if your data has lot of errors and mislabeling, again simple methods are better. Complex methods might overfit the training set.

So basically you get the idea, you want to learn functions. There are simple non-parametric techniques like Decision Trees and k-Nearest Neighbors and other parametric models (like SVMs, linear regression etc). Now, generally with small data sets with not many attributes (or sparse data), non-parametric models do good. For moderate sized data, linear SVMs and for regression, linear regression and regularized linear regressors like lasso, ridge do quite well.

Now, with more data, Neural Networks tend to do better (and also break the trade-off point for using them. Generally, more much more computationally expensive). For e.g. consider learning how to play Go which has a 19*19 board with more combinations than atoms in universe possible. Or, say learning how to classify tons of images. As you can imagine, the relationship between a ton of images cannot be modeled by a simple linear function. Convex functions are simpler as they have one maxima or minima i.e. local maxima or minima is the global one. This is not the case with a non-convex function. Hence, learning is hard. NNs (and in particular, Deep Learning) help to model such a complex function. Usually deep learning models are quite complex, and we do not have clear theoretical models for tweaking it. However, there are a great deal of heuristics.",https://www.quora.com/Which-book-is-best-for-practicing-machine-learning-problems-with-case-studies?top_ans=21881719,2016-04-22T02:01:15.598936+00:00,2017-08-30T00:45:54.193965+00:00,21,"Arindam Paul, Ph.D.",https://www.quora.com/profile/Arindam-Paul-Ph-D

Even if you read the entire book, you will learn a lot about the machine learning algorithms and system, along with common Deep Learning solutions. Also, there is a great NLP fundamental about smaller and large models along with Transformers too.

It also contains a full end to end ML project which gives you enough insights about Data science too.

Most of the code in this book are a bit overkill for specs and requirements, but that's how stuff is done in development, expecially in ML if you think about. However, just every exercise teaches you a new thing about Machine Learning programming using tried and tested techniques.

This is where I cannot compare half knowledged YouTube videos to code snippets in this book, which are there to just teach you how to do the stuff normally and professionally like a senior ML engineer. Knowing train_test_split is fine but you should also know about other test set separation methods too and how to handle data snooping bias, which is very critical and important problem to deal with.

The book explains everything freaking single thing in detail and you cannot even skip 1 single line. It took me a month to properly understand the entire chapter 2, which was very very very well written and described. Kudos to Aurelien Geron.

What are some good books on machine learning for absolute beginners?,"My suggestion to a few friends who asked me the same was Introduction to Machine Learning : Ethem Alpaydin [ http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Adaptive-Computation/dp/026201243X/ ] along with Programming Collective Intelligence: Toby Segaran [ http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325 ] for a very preliminary introduction to implementations.

Alpaydin's book, as you can see from the table of contents, covers a very wide range of topics and should be a nice introductory book. I can assure you it is not as intimidating as Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning : Christopher M. Bishop [ http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738 ] but at the same time, does not give up too much on the rigor. 
The O'Reilly book helps you be hands-on since it covers a few standard ML techniques such as recommender systems, classifiers such as decision trees, naive bayes etc and much more. Being written in Python, it helps you not get stuck in the programming language details and concentrate more on the algorithms and techniques. That said, I also have a feeling that this book might give a false impression that one knows how to implement most of the algorithms. Topics such as recommender systems and kernel methods aren't something you can possibly cover in a chapter or two and hence it is good to be aware that this book is primarily meant to only get you started with implementing ML algorithms if you aren't used to such things.

These apart, Machine Learning: Tom M.

"What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?","If you are asking about the data science and others that means you are interested in this field. If you want to know only just for your knowledge then you can read my answer and check other materials on the internet is sufficient for you but if you want to make a successful career in this field then you need to join data science courses.Many institutes provide data science courses I would suggest you to join Learnbay for complete knowledge and learn required skills for data science career.

Here i will mention details about these terms-

Data analysis is a procedure of investigating ,transforming , cleaning and training the data with the aim of finding some useful information, recommending conclusions and helping in decision making.

Data analytics consist of data collection and in general inspect the data and it has one or more usage. It is a conventional form of analytics which is used in many ways.

Big Data refers to the vast volume of data that is difficult to store and process in real-time. The act of accessing and storing large amounts of information for analytics has been a long time.

Data Mining is also referred to as data or knowledge discovery, is the process of analyzing data and transforming it into insight that informs business decisions.

Machine Learning means that the programs depend on some data, used as a training set to fine tune some models and algorithms parameters. ML is a group of techniques used by data scientists that allow computers to learn from data.

Data Science unifies statistics, data analysis and machine learning to understand and analyse phenomena through data.Data science encloses many break through technology like-AI, DL and e.t.c

"What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?","In today's data-driven world, it's essential to understand the distinctions between various terms commonly used in the field of data and analytics. Let's explore the differences between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data to gain a clearer understanding of these concepts.

Data Analytics: Data Analytics involves examining large datasets to uncover meaningful insights, trends, and patterns. It focuses on deriving actionable insights from data to make informed business decisions. For instance, a retail company might use data analytics to analyze customer purchasing patterns and optimize its inventory management strategies.

Data Analysis: Data Analysis is a broader term that encompasses various techniques used to examine data, draw conclusions, and solve problems. It involves inspecting and cleaning datasets, applying statistical methods, and employing visualization techniques to gain insights. An example of data analysis would be analyzing sales data to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for a marketing campaign.

Data Mining: Data Mining refers to the process of extracting valuable information or knowledge from large datasets. It involves identifying patterns, relationships, or anomalies in the data that may not be immediately apparent. Data mining techniques can be used in various domains, such as customer segmentation, fraud detection, or predicting user behavior.

Data Science: Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of statistics, mathematics, and computer science to extract knowledge and insights from data. It encompasses all stages of the data lifecycle, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation. Data scientists utilize a wide range of techniques and tools to solve complex problems and make data-driven decisions. I found online resources such as Logicmojo, Upgrad, Great Learning and Udacity providing data science courses. I took the Logicmojo data science course to be incredibly helpful in acquiring these skills. They provided job assistance as well. At Logicmojo, they offer a comprehensive data science course that covers all the essential concepts and tools you need to succeed in this field. Whether you're just starting out or looking to advance your career, our course provides you with the knowledge and skills you need to become a successful data scientist.

Machine Learning: Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training models on historical data and using them to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. A common example of machine learning is spam email filtering, where the model learns to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails based on past examples.

Big Data: Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be effectively processed using traditional data processing applications. It involves the storage, processing, and analysis of vast amounts of data to extract insights and value. Big Data technologies, such as Hadoop or Apache Spark, enable organizations to handle and derive value from these massive datasets.

To summarize:

 * Data Analytics focuses on extracting actionable insights from data for business decisions.
 * Data Analysis encompasses techniques used to examine and draw conclusions from data.
 * Data Mining involves discovering patterns and relationships in large datasets.
 * Data Science combines statistics, mathematics, and computer science to extract knowledge from data.
 * Machine Learning enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.
 * Big Data refers to the processing and analysis of large and complex datasets.
As we've seen, there are similarities and differences between data analysis, data science, data mining, machine learning, and big data. Despite the fact that the topics are closely related in many ways, each has its own implications, application, and areas of expertise. If you are interested in any of the subjects then I will say it's a great time to get hands-on experience as they have lucrative careers.

"What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?","I had been wanting to take a stab at this one since a few days, but it always looked like an enormous task, because this question has used too many words. In addition, this is a question on which a lot of people have their eyes, and a lot of others have already written elaborate answers.

Let me first re-order all the important words:

 * Big data
 * Data mining
 * Data analysis
 * Analytics
 * Machine learning
 * Data science
Imagine that you want to become a data scientist, and work in a big organization like Amazon, Intel, Google, FB, Apple and so on.

How would that look like?

 * You would have to deal with big data, you would have to write computer programs in SQL, Python, R, C++, Java, Scala, Ruby…and so on, to only maintain big-data databases. You would be called a database manager.
 * As an engineer working on process control, or someone wanting to streamline operations of the company, you would perform Data Mining, and Data Analysis; You may use simple software to do this where you would only run a lot of codes written by others, or you may be writing your elaborate codes in SQL, Python, R and you would be doing data mining, data cleaning, data analysis, modeling, predictive modeling and so on.
 * All this will be called Analytics. Several software exist to do this. One popular one is Tableau. Some others are JMP and SAS. Lot of people do everything online where a SAP based business intelligence setup can be used. Here, simple reporting can be done easily.
 * Further, you would then be able to use machine learning to derive conclusions, and come up with predictions, wherever analytical answers are not possible. Think of analytical answers as [If/then] type of computer programs, where all the input conditions are already known, and only a few parameters change.
 * Machine learning uses statistical analysis to partition data. An example would be this: Read the comments written by various people on Yelp, and predict from the comments whether the person would have marked a restaurant 4 star or 5 star.
 * If that is not enough, you would be able to use deep learning as well. Deep learning is used to process data such as musical files, images, even text data such as natural languages, where data are enormous, but their type is very diverse.
 * You would use everything to your advantage ~ analytical solutions, partitioning data, hacking mindset, automation by programming, reporting, deriving conclusions, making decisions, taking actions, and telling stories about your data.
 * Last but not the least, a part of this will be happening on cruise control, where you may not be there physically, but the programs you may have created would do most of the things themselves. Probably if you take it to the level of AI, one day it may get smarter than you, needless to say it would already be faster than you. One day it can go to the level that it can surprise you with the solutions that you may not even have imagined.
 * Now you are a data scientist, and what you would do is called Data-science.
 * Whatever you would do may or may not be seen by people outside your company such as people asking Alexa various questions if you work for Amazon, or people asking questions to ok Google if you work for Google. Or they may not be getting to see anything you do. Your functions would be helping the companies engineer things better.
 * To do all this, you may need lots of expertise in handling data and knowledge of a few programming languages.
 * One popular data science Venn Diagram I have seen on internet is here: Note that a data scientist is at the intersection of a lot of things. Communication, statistics, programming, and business.

I only extracted a few sections out of it conveniently because I only wanted to add on the top of someone else’s knowledge, and put together these concepts like a story so as to inspire the people to think about this subject and begin their own journeys.

Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity [ http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/big-data-the-next-frontier-for-innovation ]

I will answer a few questions step by step, and wherever possible, I will give a few pictures, or plots to show you how things look like.

McKinsey consultants! You are amazing, so if you read things written in this answer that were typed by you at some point in time, I give full credit to you.

 * What do we mean by ""big data""?
 * “Big data” refers to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze. This definition is intentionally subjective and incorporates a moving definition of how big a dataset needs to be in order to be considered big data—i.e., we need not define big data in terms of being larger than a certain number of terabytes (thousands of gigabytes). We assume that, as technology advances over time, the size of datasets that qualify as big data will also increase. Also note that the definition can vary by sector, depending on what kinds of software tools are commonly available and what sizes of datasets are common in a particular industry. With those caveats, big data in many sectors today will range from a few dozen terabytes to multiple petabytes (thousands of terabytes).
 * What is a typical size of data I may have to deal with? Sometimes GBs, sometimes just a few MBs, sometimes up to as high as 1TB. Sometimes the complexity is nothing. The data may be representing the same thing. Sometimes the complexity can be very high. I might have a giant file full of a lot of data and logs which can be structured or unstructured.
 * Think for example about Macy’s. There are thousands of stores, selling thousands of items per day to millions of customers. If Macy’s wants to derive a conclusion ~ should they rather diversify in shoes, or should they rather diversify in women’s purses? How would they make this decision?
 * Well then, a natural question is: How do we measure the value of big data?
 * Measuring data Measuring volumes of data provokes a number of methodological questions. First, how can we distinguish data from information and from insight? Common definitions describe data as being raw indicators, information as the meaningful interpretation of those signals, and insight as an actionable piece of knowledge.
 * For example - In this chart, someone has plotted cost per student for various regions. It makes a few of them stand out.
Let us now talk about analysis: This is big part of being a data scientist.

 * TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYZING BIG DATA
 * There are many techniques that draw on disciplines such as statistics and computer science (particularly machine learning) that can be used to analyze datasets. This list is by no means exhaustive. Indeed, researchers continue to develop new techniques and improve on existing ones, particularly in response to the need to analyze new combinations of data.
 * Also, note that not all of these techniques strictly require the use of big data—some of them can be applied effectively to smaller datasets (e.g., A/B testing, regression analysis). However, all of the techniques listed here can be applied to big data and, in general, larger and more diverse datasets can be used to generate more numerous and insightful results than smaller, less diverse ones.
 * A/B testing. A technique in which a control group is compared with a variety of test groups in order to determine what treatments (i.e., changes) will improve a given objective variable, e.g., marketing response rate. This technique is also known as split testing or bucket testing. An example application is determining what copy text, layouts, images, or colors will improve conversion rates on an e-commerce Web site. Big data enables huge numbers of tests to be executed and analyzed, ensuring that groups are of sufficient size to detect meaningful (i.e., statistically significant) differences between the control 28 and treatment groups (see statistics). When more than one variable is simultaneously manipulated in the treatment, the multivariate generalization of this technique, which applies statistical modeling, is often called “A/B/N” testing. What would an example look like?
 * Imagine that Coke signs up with Facebook to work on marketing and sales. Facebook would put advertisements according to the customers. It can create versions of advertisements. Not all versions will suit to every geography. Some will suit to USA, some will suit to India. Some can suit to Indians living in USA. What Facebook can do is to choose a subset of people from a massive pool, and pass advertisements to them in their feed according to whether those people love food or not. For each advertisement, Facebook will collect the responses and accordingly determine which advertisement does better, and on a larger pool of people it will use a better one. Does data science let someone determine better what the answer should be? Absolutely!
 * Association rule learning. A set of techniques for discovering interesting relationships, i.e., “association rules,” among variables in large databases. These techniques consist of a variety of algorithms to generate and test possible rules. One application is market basket analysis, in which a retailer can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing (a commonly cited example is the discovery that many supermarket shoppers who buy diapers also tend to buy beer).
 * Classification. A set of techniques to identify the categories in which new data points belong, based on a training set containing data points that have already been categorized. One application is the prediction of segment-specific customer behavior (e.g., buying decisions, churn rate, consumption rate) where there is a clear hypothesis or objective outcome. These techniques are often described as supervised learning because of the existence of a training set; they stand in contrast to cluster analysis, a type of unsupervised learning.
 * Cluster analysis. A statistical method for classifying objects that splits a diverse group into smaller groups of similar objects, whose characteristics of similarity are not known in advance. An example of cluster analysis is segmenting consumers into self-similar groups for targeted marketing. This is a type of unsupervised learning because training data are not used. This technique is in contrast to classification, a type of supervised learning.
 * Crowdsourcing. A technique for collecting data submitted by a large group of people or community (i.e., the “crowd”) through an open call, usually through networked media such as the Web.28 This is a type of mass collaboration and an instance of using Web 2.0.29 Data fusion and data integration.
 * A set of techniques that integrate and analyze data from multiple sources in order to develop insights in ways that are more efficient and potentially more accurate than if they were developed by analyzing a single source of data.
 * Data mining. A set of techniques to extract patterns from large datasets by combining methods from statistics and machine learning with database management. These techniques include association rule learning, cluster analysis, classification, and regression. Applications include mining customer data to determine segments most likely to respond to an offer, mining human resources data to identify characteristics of most successful employees, or market basket analysis to model the purchase behavior of customers.
 * Ensemble learning. Using multiple predictive models (each developed using statistics and/or machine learning) to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent models. This is a type of supervised learning.
 * Genetic algorithms. A technique used for optimization that is inspired by the process of natural evolution or “survival of the fittest.” In this technique, potential solutions are encoded as “chromosomes” that can combine and mutate. These individual chromosomes are selected for survival within a modeled “environment” that determines the fitness or performance of each individual in the population. Often described as a type of “evolutionary algorithm,” these algorithms are well-suited for solving nonlinear problems. Examples of applications include improving job scheduling in manufacturing and optimizing the performance of an investment portfolio.
 * Machine learning. A subspecialty of computer science (within a field historically called “artificial intelligence”) concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data. A major focus of machine learning research is to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. Natural language processing is an example of machine learning.
 * Natural language processing (NLP). A set of techniques from a sub-specialty of computer science (within a field historically called “artificial intelligence”) and linguistics that uses computer algorithms to analyze human (natural) language. Many NLP techniques are types of machine learning. One application of NLP is using sentiment analysis on social media to determine how prospective customers are reacting to a branding campaign. Data from social media, analyzed by natural language processing, can be combined with real-time sales data, in order to determine what effect a marketing campaign is having on customer sentiment and purchasing behavior.
 * Neural networks. Computational models, inspired by the structure and workings of biological neural networks (i.e., the cells and connections within a brain), that find patterns in data. Neural networks are well-suited for finding nonlinear patterns. They can be used for pattern recognition and optimization. Some neural network applications involve supervised learning and others involve unsupervised learning. Examples of applications include identifying high-value customers that are at risk of leaving a particular company and identifying fraudulent insurance claims.
 * Network analysis. A set of techniques used to characterize relationships among discrete nodes in a graph or a network. In social network analysis, connections between individuals in a community or organization are analyzed, e.g., how information travels, or who has the most influence over whom. Examples of applications include identifying key opinion leaders to target for marketing, and identifying bottlenecks in enterprise information flows.
 * Optimization. A portfolio of numerical techniques used to redesign complex systems and processes to improve their performance according to one or more objective measures (e.g., cost, speed, or reliability). Examples of applications include improving operational processes such as scheduling, routing, and floor layout, and making strategic decisions such as product range strategy, linked investment analysis, and R&D portfolio strategy. Genetic algorithms are an example of an optimization technique. Same way, mixed integer programming is another way.
 * Pattern recognition. A set of machine learning techniques that assign some sort of output value (or label) to a given input value (or instance) according to a specific algorithm. Classification techniques are an example.
 * Predictive modeling. A set of techniques in which a mathematical model is created or chosen to best predict the probability of an outcome. An example of an application in customer relationship management is the use of predictive models to estimate the likelihood that a customer will “churn” (i.e., change providers) or the likelihood that a customer can be cross-sold another product. Regression is one example of the many predictive modeling techniques.
 * Regression. A set of statistical techniques to determine how the value of the dependent variable changes when one or more independent variables is modified. Often used for forecasting or prediction. Examples of applications include forecasting sales volumes based on various market and economic variables or determining what measurable manufacturing parameters most influence customer satisfaction. Used for data mining.
 * Sentiment analysis. Application of natural language processing and other analytic techniques to identify and extract subjective information from source text material. Key aspects of these analyses include identifying the feature, aspect, or product about which a sentiment is being expressed, and determining the type, “polarity” (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral) and the degree and strength of the sentiment. Examples of applications include companies applying sentiment analysis to analyze social media (e.g., blogs, microblogs, and social networks) to determine how different customer segments and stakeholders are reacting to their products and actions.
 * Signal processing. A set of techniques from electrical engineering and applied mathematics originally developed to analyze discrete and continuous signals, i.e., representations of analog physical quantities (even if represented digitally) such as radio signals, sounds, and images. This category includes techniques from signal detection theory, which quantifies the ability to discern between signal and noise. Sample applications include modeling for time series analysis or implementing data fusion to determine a more precise reading by combining data from a set of less precise data sources (i.e., extracting the signal from the noise). Signal processing techniques can be used to implement some types of data fusion. One example of an application is sensor data from the Internet of Things being combined to develop an integrated perspective on the performance of a complex distributed system such as an oil refinery.
 * Spatial analysis. A set of techniques, some applied from statistics, which analyze the topological, geometric, or geographic properties encoded in a data set. Often the data for spatial analysis come from geographic information systems (GIS) that capture data including location information, e.g., addresses or latitude/longitude coordinates. Examples of applications include the incorporation of spatial data into spatial regressions (e.g., how is consumer willingness to purchase a product correlated with location?) or simulations (e.g., how would a manufacturing supply chain network perform with sites in different locations?).
 * Statistics. The science of the collection, organization, and interpretation of data, including the design of surveys and experiments. Statistical techniques are often used to make judgments about what relationships between variables could have occurred by chance (the “null hypothesis”), and what relationships between variables likely result from some kind of underlying causal relationship (i.e., that are “statistically significant”). Statistical techniques are also used to reduce the likelihood of Type I errors (“false positives”) and Type II errors (“false negatives”). An example of an application is A/B testing to determine what types of marketing material will most increase revenue.
 * Supervised learning. The set of machine learning techniques that infer a function or relationship from a set of training data. Examples include classification and support vector machines.30 This is different from unsupervised learning.
 * Simulation. Modeling the behavior of complex systems, often used for forecasting, predicting and scenario planning. Monte Carlo simulations, for example, are a class of algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling, i.e., running thousands of simulations, each based on different assumptions. The result is a histogram that gives a probability distribution of outcomes. One application is assessing the likelihood of meeting financial targets given uncertainties about the success of various initiatives.
 * Time series analysis. Set of techniques from both statistics and signal processing for analyzing sequences of data points, representing values at successive times, to extract meaningful characteristics from the data. Examples of time series analysis include the hourly value of a stock market index or the number of patients diagnosed with a given condition every day.
 * Time series forecasting. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values of a time series based on known past values of the same or other series. Some of these techniques, e.g., structural modeling, decompose a series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which can be useful for identifying cyclical patterns in the data. Examples of applications include forecasting sales figures, or predicting the number of people who will be diagnosed with an infectious disease.
 * Unsupervised learning. A set of machine learning techniques that finds hidden structure in unlabeled data. Cluster analysis is an example of unsupervised learning (in contrast to supervised learning).
 * Visualization. Techniques used for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate, understand, and improve the results of big data analyses. This expands into creating dashboards, on web or desktop platforms.

"What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?","Lots of good answers already - however the question is such that I think perhaps a business rather than technical description might be warranted.

First things first, doing stuff with data, whatever you want to call it is going to require some investment - fortunately the entry price has come right down and you can do pretty much all of this at home with a reasonably priced machine and online access to a host of free or purchased resources. Commercial organizations have realized that there is huge value hiding in the data and are employing the techniques you ask about to realize that value. Ultimately what all of this work produces is insights, things that you may not have known otherwise. Insights are the items of information that cause a change in behavior.

Let's begin with a real world example, looking at a farm that is growing strawberries (here's a simple backgrounder The Secret Life Of California's World-Class Strawberries [ http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/05/17/152522900/the-secret-life-of-californias-world-class-strawberries ], this High-Tech Greenhouse Yields Winter Strawberries [ http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2013/12/high-tech-greenhouse-yields-winter-strawberries ] , and this Growing Strawberry Plants Commercially [ http://strawberryplants.org/2010/09/growing-strawberry-plants-commercially/ ])

What would a farmer need to consider if they are growing strawberries? The farmer will be selecting the types of plants, fertilizers, pesticides. Also looking at machinery, transportation, storage and labor. Weather, water supply and pestlience are also likely concerns. Ultimately the farmer is also investigating the market price so supply and demand and timing of the harvest (which will determine the dates to prepare the soil, to plant, to thin out the crop, to nurture and to harvest) are also concerns.

So the objective of all the data work is to create insights that will help the farmer make a set of decisions that will optimize their commercial growing operation.

Let's think about the data available to the farmer, here's a simplified breakdown:

1. Historic weather patterns

2. Plant breeding data and productivity for each strain

3. Fertilizer specifications

4. Pesticide specifications

5. Soil productivity data

6. Pest cycle data

7. Machinery cost, reliability, fault and cost data

8. Water supply data

9. Historic supply and demand data

10. Market spot price and futures data

Now to explain the definitions in context (with some made-up insights, so if you're a strawberry farmer, this might not be the best set of examples):

Big Data: Using all of the data available to provide new insights to a problem. Traditionally the farmer may have made their decisions based on only a few of the available data points, for example selecting the breeds of strawberries that had the highest yield for their soil and water table. The Big Data approach may show that the market price slightly earlier in the season is a lot higher and local weather patterns are such that a new breed variation of strawberry would do well. So the insight would be switching to a new breed would allow the farmer to take advantage of a higher prices earlier in the season, and the cost of labor, storage and transportation at that time would be slightly lower. There's another thing you might hear in the Big Data marketing hype: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity - so there is a huge amount of data here, a lot of data is being generated each minute (so weather patterns, stock prices and machine sensors), and the data is liable to change at any time (e.g. a new source of social media data that is a great predictor for consumer demand),

Data Analysis: Analysis is really a heuristic activity, where scanning through all the data the analyst gains some insight. Looking at a single data set - say the one on machine reliability, I might be able to say that certain machines are expensive to purchase but have fewer general operational faults leading to less downtime and lower maintenance costs. There are other cheaper machines that are more costly in the long run. The farmer might not have enough working capital to afford the expensive machine and they would have to decide whether to purchase the cheaper machine and incur the additional maintenance costs and risk the downtime or to borrow money with the interest payment, to afford the expensive machine.

Data Analytics: Analytics is about applying a mechanical or algorithmic process to derive the insights for example running through various data sets looking for meaningful correlations between them. Looking at the weather data and pest data we see that there is a high correlation of a certain type of fungus when the humidity level reaches a certain point. The future weather projections for the next few months (during planting season) predict a low humidity level and therefore lowered risk of that fungus. For the farmer this might mean being able to plant a certain type of strawberry, higher yield, higher market price and not needing to purchase a certain fungicide.

Data Mining: this term was most widely used in the late 90's and early 00's when a business consolidated all of its data into an Enterprise Data Warehouse. All of that data was brought together to discover previously unknown trends, anomalies and correlations such as the famed 'beer and diapers' correlation (Diapers, Beer, and data science in retail [ http://canworksmart.com/diapers-beer-retail-predictive-analytics/ ]). Going back to the strawberries, assuming that our farmer was a large conglomerate like Cargill, then all of the data above would be sitting ready for analysis in the warehouse so questions such as this could be answered with relative ease: What is the best time to harvest strawberries to get the highest market price? Given certain soil conditions and rainfall patterns at a location, what are the highest yielding strawberry breeds that we should grow?

Data Science: a combination of mathematics, statistics, programming, the context of the problem being solved, ingenious ways of capturing data that may not be being captured right now plus the ability to look at things 'differently' (like this Why UPS Trucks Don't Turn Left [ http://priceonomics.com/why-ups-trucks-dont-turn-left/ ] ) and of course the significant and necessary activity of cleansing, preparing and aligning the data. So in the strawberry industry we're going to be building some models that tell us when the optimal time is to sell, which gives us the time to harvest which gives us a combination of breeds to plant at various times to maximize overall yield. We might be short of consumer demand data - so maybe we figure out that when strawberry recipes are published online or on television, then demand goes up - and Tweets and Instagram or Facebook likes provide an indicator of demand. Then we need to align demand data up with market price to give us the final insights and maybe to create a way to drive up demand by promoting certain social media activity.

Machine Learning: this is one of the tools used by data scientist, where a model is created that mathematically describes a certain process and its outcomes, then the model provides recommendations and monitors the results once those recommendations are implemented and uses the results to improve the model. When Google provides a set of results for the search term ""strawberry"" people might click on the first 3 entries and ignore the 4th one - over time, that 4th entry will not appear as high in the results because the machine is learning what users are responding to. Applied to the farm, when the system creates recommendations for which breeds of strawberry to plant, and collects the results on the yeilds for each berry under various soil and weather conditions, machine learning will allow it to build a model that can make a better set of recommendations for the next growing season.

I am adding this next one because there seems to be some popular misconceptions as to what this means. My belief is that 'predictive' is much overused and hyped.

Predictive Analytics: Creating a quantitative model that allows an outcome to be predicted based on as much historical information as can be gathered. In this input data, there will be multiple variables to consider, some of which may be significant and others less significant in determining the outcome. The predictive model determines what signals in the data can be used to make an accurate prediction. The models become useful if there are certain variables than can be changed that will increase chances of a desired outcome. So what might be useful for our strawberry farmer to want to predict? Let's go back to the commercial strawberry grower who is selling product to grocery retailers and food manufacturers - the supply deals are in tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars and there is a large salesforce. How can they predict whether a deal is likely to close or not? To begin with, they could look at the history of that company and the quantities and frequencies of produce purchased over time, the most recent purchases being stronger indicators. They could then look at the salesperson's history of selling that product to those types of companies. Those are the obvious indicators. Less obvious ones would be the what competing growers are also bidding for the contract, perhaps certain competitors always win because they always undercut. How many visits the rep has paid to the prospective client over the year, how many emails and phone calls. How many product complaints has the prospective client made regarding product quality? Have all our deliveries been the correct quantity, delivered on time? All of these variables may contribute to the next deal being closed. If there is enough historical data, we can build a model that will predict that a deal will close or not. We can use a sample of the historic data set aside to test if the model works. If we are confident, then we can use it to predict the next deal

"What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?","Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, and Machine learning are very important concepts in today’s era and to master them you need to understand them in-depth you need to have a strong understanding and adaptability.

Now let’s see the differences among these to understand these more deeply and how it is been implemented 📐

 * ✳️ Data Science: Data Science is a concept that is used to deal with big data which comprises data cleaning, preparations, and analysis. A data scientist uses all these mechanisms and extracts the critical information to make an informed decision.
 * ✳️ Data Analytics: A data analyst mainly focuses on statistics, visualizing data, and with this data making a concrete decision.
 * ✳️ Machine Learning: Machine learning can be defined as the mechanism of using algorithms to extract data, learn from it, and then forecast these data using patterns and trends.
 * ✳️ Data Analysis: It is a process where the analyst focuses on all the gathered data to make some insights out of that.
 * ✳️ Big Data: These are the large data sets that are used to understand patterns, and trends, which comprise the behavior and interactions.
So, now you might have an idea of these terminologies and how to start learning them in detail, so that you can learn their core and make a career ahead in this field. Gaining this knowledge with the help of some sources would be quite helpful, as you can begin the learning process by reading books, watching videos, doing self-study, or getting enrolled in some online courses.

How to begin the process: 🔖

As I mentioned above look for some reliable source of learning so that you can cover all the major topics and make a better understanding of the concepts and subject. Online courses are the new mode of learning from where students can begin their journey and acquire a bachelor’s degree in the field.

Is a bachelor’s degree sufficient or master’s degree is also required? 🧾

Definitions, flow charts and articles about “what is data science” sometimes cause confusion. It is okay, and there are many aspects of data science. If a person learns every aspect of data science, they will likely forget many aspects within a week. The data science field is very vast, and you need skills and experience to be called a proficient data scientist. The experience one requires to be domain-oriented.

We are glad to live in a world full of information. You can have the freedom to learn whatever you want.. However, in data science, you must know the reason for choosing it as a career. When your reason is strong enough, and you face any setbacks or challenges, it will keep you on track. Another important task before stepping into data science is knowing which domain you want to grow your expertise in.

I will help you learn everything about data science. What direction should you take in your professional life? What will your responsibilities be as a data scientist? What is the most effective data science training programme?

It doesn't matter how you learn data science; doing projects is the most important factor. Projects will give you a practical understanding of data science. Many beginners and experts compete on kaggle performing projects, which is fun. To make your profile stand out, a project experience is more essential than a top university certificate.

The roadmap to getting started as a data scientist are:

1. Knowing the reason for choosing data science
2. Choosing domain of interest
3. Learning the basics of must-have skills
4. Implementing gained skills on real projects

These are ideal steps every data scientist has followed. As the experience increases, your expertise will grow. You can also switch to different domains of interest.

Day to day task you would be performing in data science:

There are four types of tasks you would be performing such as collecting and cleaning the data, insight generation, performing ML algorithms, and communicating with managers or clients.

Collecting and cleaning the data: The data collection and cleansing seems easy, but data scientists have to spend days on this process. In a project, when you perform, you get created and clean data, but in real life, working as a data scientist, you need to collect and clean the data independently.

Insight generation: This step defines the quality of a data scientist. Deriving the useful insight from cleaned data makes a data scientist creative and gameplay of the strategies. In this step, mathematical, statistical and visualization come into use.

ML algorithm: In this, a data scientist feeds the computer insightful collected data. The methods used in ML algorithms are recommender system, supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision problems.

Communication: This is the process of expression; a data scientist explains the created strategies to managers or clients. Explaining complex data in a simple way, a data scientist needs in-depth understanding. Of course, these things get improved over time, but you should also be improving your communication skills.

What is data science?,"You might have come across the term “Data Science” at least once in recent times. If you are an IT person, you might have an idea about the field, and if you are not from the techies, you may be curious to know what this term is that everyone is raving about. So to define its data science is a field that requires you to analyse a data set through cleansing, aggregating, and manipulating data to carry out the said analysis. This can help better recognise the trends in the data you are analysing and form insights that will better your work in the future. Several ed-tech companies such as Simplilearn, Udemy, Edx and Learnbay have been offering various courses in the field. So if you want to start learning, then do check these platforms out.

History of Data Science

Let’s see the beginning of data science. Data Science appears to be quite new; however, in 1962, john W.Tukey first used data science even when it wasn’t officially recognised as a field yet. He predicted the effect of electronic computing on data analysis as an empirical science. From the beginning of the 21st century, data science was abundantly noticed by many scientists and working professionals. The term Data Science was coined by William.S at the beginning of the 21 st century. Consequently, the term began to popularise and evolve, and It is what we know today as Data Science.

According to John Rauser, a data scientist at amazon he claims that astronomer Tobias Mayer was the first data scientist to have existed. What’s shocking is that he was born in 1723! That’s four centuries in rewind! So why did Rauser claim this, you may ask. Mayer explained the moon’s motion using spherical motion trigonometry, and to achieve this, he compiled the data points as many as nine times. Analysing data is data science; hence Tobias Mayer was indeed a data scientist.

Applications of Data Science

These are some of the fields where data science is being used:

 * Fraud and Risk Detection: Many fraud detection systems use data science to understand how misconduct happens and use this data to detect any malicious activity later on. Risk and Fraud Detection is one of the most common applications of data science and is easy to do projects when starting with Data Science.
 * Healthcare: Data Science can be used in the early detection of life-threatening diseases such as cancer, AIDS, Autoimmune disorders and many more. This application has been saving numerous lives worldwide as most of the diseases can be brought under control when detected early.
 * Internet Search: When you run a google search or use any other search engine, the topics you will see in the first tab depend on two things i) Search Engine Optimisation and ii) Relevancy. This relevancy is found by the data of the demographic searching these websites and which one people are highly likely to stay in.
 * Targeted Advertising: The ad recommendations, Movie recommendations, and any recommendations that we get on the internet are thanks to data science. Companies use data science to analyse your search history and market products and services according to what you will be drawn to as per their analysis.
 * Website Recommendations: Sometimes, you will get in links on blogs, or when you research something, certain websites are recommended to you. All this is possible only due to data science.
 * Advanced Image Recognition: You can see that mobile devices these days have a feature of face recognition. This will not allow anyone but you to have access to your devices. This technology uses a combined system or data science and neural networks to map out your features and recognise your face or any image related searches that you are making.
 * Speech Recognition: Electronic assistants such as Google Assistant, Alexa and Siri can reply on command by recognising your voice.
 * Airline Route Planning: To find which route is the best for an aircraft to reach its destination is very difficult. You have to take a lot of factors into consideration, such as Which flight will be flying in the selected route at the given time, Air traffic at the time of aviation, Altitude of all the aircraft flying at the moment. All this is in the dataset form, and hence, data science has made it easy to plan air routes.
 * Gaming: Mapping the controller movements to the movement of the game is also the magic of data science.
 * Augmented Reality: Using Data Science in augmented reality can allow multiple users in tracking neural networks and make sure that the machine also performs well.

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"I think that Joseph gave a very comprehensive answer to that question. Undeniably, at the top of that list are the common packages you would encounter as a developer in the field.

However, what none of these comments really touches on is the length of time it takes to become familiar with each of these topics. They are actually quite deep and bad answers that results in 100% classification accuracy are common due to over-fitting. 

If you just want an entry-level position I don't see the need to know anything past Naive Bayes, LDA, and SVM which you can get from most common numpy + scipy packages. Linear algebra will help, but if you understand principal component analysis and singular value decomposition then these things above are 80% of the theory you will need in practice.

I would study harder on learning how to get good features more than anything else to be honest. Classifiers are a well-understood mathematical science at this point. Knowing how to get good features and build good kernels is where the biggest bang for your employment buck might be in more advanced roles.

Since you are probably going to want to implement these you should know your basic programming languages that most people who recruit use, like those mentioned above.

I seriously doubt knowing any fancy mathematics will matter very much. Knowing about reproducing kernel hilbert spaces is interesting, but often in most startups will just want you to keep implementing until it works right on the deployment end. Doing this means you just have to get something to work with the data you have been given. Perhaps this is slightly un-intellectual, but it is often how early-stage ventures work.

If you want to be a data-science person and treated as a scientist, or as anything more than a highly paid technician, and work at the management level you should consider formal education in machine learning and computer science. A bright 15 year old can get a job at a startup if he can do the work, but I wouldn't ask him to lead a team unless they had some other extraordinary capabilities that are actually quite rare.",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=960457,2012-01-24T22:37:52.451282+00:00,2013-03-16T22:32:19.589759+00:00,458,Anonymous,

ML is being leveraged by big and small companies—ads that google and facebook show, movie recommendations from Netflix, and any number of financial analysis systems or medical research. Even some of the stuff that may sound mundane can be pretty interesting—working for a high volume stock trade group probably pays extremely well but you probably shouldn’t expect to have a life; doing astronomical research and analysis (if you’re into that) will probably be much more mentally rewarding with much, much smaller pay checks.

Step 1: Learn to program. I’d personally suggest Python if you have very little coding experience. Python has a good set of programming tools that lets you quickly run new code and you can even run simple web guis locally that will likely make learning much more interesting and fun. There are any number of ML Python examples out there that you can play with and you can fudge stuff in the programs BUT ultimately to get hired anywhere you need to write clean maintainable code. Which gets us to . . .

Step 1.5: Learn to actually program: By the time you are able to write a bubble sort without thinking much about it in Python you’ll probably already be able to write it in Java or C++ with minimal google searches and the random “I forgot a closing brace” type stuff. At some point though you will need to know, at least at a high level, how a language goes from the stuff you type to making the machine dance. The simple truth is if you understand the ins-and-outs of one modern language you can re-write it in any other.

The bigger issue moving from playing around to being a developer is development tools. I’ve been on eclipse for a long time so I think everyone uses it. I could be wrong.

Step 2: Learn how various ML procedures and algorithms are used. 99.8% of any ML stuff isn’t about re-writing a naive bayes algorithm it is about applying it (and others). If you have a decent understanding of stats and how to apply it you don’t need an insanely deep understanding of the underlying math. If that is what truly interests you go for it.

INTERLUDE: I’ve been assuming you’re looking at the programming side of ML. On that front, just like any other “programming” job there are a ton of different roles. Being a “coder” seems to be the assumed profession but there is Quality Assurance, Architect, User Interface, User Experience, etc. I don’t actually do any coding at all—I deal with builds and getting code into the production servers in a CI (continuous integration) environment. ON that front there are a slew of tools like Jenkins, chef, blah, blah blah.

If you’re dedicated you can get your foot in the door at a company and get paid. If you’re good you can at least help debugging some open source apps. If you’re really good you can help some of the open source apps even if it isn’t providing code.

Step 3: Take a deep breath. Go back to step 1 and see how you’ve progressed. Everyone I work with is constantly learning. They are not worrying about it though—the stuff changes but essentially only the good stuff bubbles up to the top. If you get the fundamentals everything else falls in place. If you know Python in and out learning Java is no problem; learning Scala is again simple.",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=23868277,2016-06-13T19:10:42.633782+00:00,,6,Jack Briody,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Briody
What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"I’ve interviewed candidates for Big Data & ML positions.

First of all, I care about fluency in at least one programming language with algorithms/data structures and crystal clear fundamentals of computer science. This is all that is “needed”. Other skills are “a plus” (well, at least for positions %3C 8 years of experience).

If the candidate doesn’t clearly get past these, I don’t really find the interest in deep diving into Big Data/ML knowledge.

For really senior positions, I haven’t interviewed people myself, but that is where companies care about specifics in addition to the basics. Specifics could be things like knowledge of Apache Spark for instance. These should be explicitly called out on the job description.

Hope that helps!",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=50598896,2017-07-16T20:19:09.237807+00:00,,3,Sahil Sareen,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sahil-Sareen
What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"Machine learning is undoubtedly one of the most debated topics in all business sectors. Hence, it can be said that learning the basics of machine learning can help you develop competitive skills for the job market. Plus, machine learning algorithms are used for assisting companies to identify and extract insights from data, which would otherwise be of no value.

Most modern businesses are altering processes and performance in many departments with the insights gained from predictions. Some of the popular approaches used in machine learning are discussed below:

 * Reinforcement learning
 * Semi-supervised learning
 * Learning without supervision
 * Learning that is supervised
Here are some of the skills that are required in machine learning:

 * Probability and statistics - It can be said that a good section of machine learning is highly dependent on algorithms that are further based on different theories. In addition, different statistical models are involved with machine learning. Those are Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Naive Bayes among others.
 * Applied mathematics and algorithms - In this field, it is mandatory to have a good understanding of algorithms. Some of these algorithms are convex optimization, gradient descent, partial differential equations, Lagrange and quadratic programming, and so on.
 * Programming languages - Machine learning also requires knowledge of trending programming languages like Python, C++, and R. If any student is aiming to build a job in machine learning then, learning programming languages can help them to reduce many difficulties. However, Scrumpy and Scipy Libraries are two crucial topics in programming languages.
Some of the best options to learn these skills are:

1. Online course from Learnbay or Simplilearn-
Course name:

 * Learnbay- Advance AI and ML course for tech professionals
 * Simplilearn- Professional Certificate Program in AI and Machine Learning
Both these institutes will offer you live and interactive training on the course, hence you will be able to understand the in-depth knowledge in this field. Plus, these courses will offer you multiple real-time projects in ML.

However, compared to Simplilearn, Learnbay has more features such as:

 * IBM certification - This institute will offer you IBM certification after the course completion along with micro-skill certification and project completion certification. This will add brownie points to your CV.
 * Project innovation lab - Learnbay offers innovation labs for capstone projects where you will be placed in a team or be required to work independently for the projects under supervision. Learnbay has innovation labs in Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai Delhi, and Pune.
 * Hybrid mode of learning - They offer both online and offline modes of learning where you will learn theories and concepts online whereas do projects offline in innovation labs.
 * Domain specialization - This feature is only available in Learnbay where students will be offered domain-specific training in BFSI, Sales, Marketing, and HR to name a few. With specific domain knowledge, you will be able to compete with experienced candidates as well.
 * 12+ real-time and capstone projects - They offer multiple projects in your chosen domain. Some of the projects offered are Churn forecasting for the telecom industry using R programming with ML, Condition-based preventative maintenance and fault prediction in-depth, etc.
2. Self-study from websites and online platforms-

This is an option to learn the skills of machine learning at your own pace and time for free. There are many YouTube channels and free websites that will offer you study materials for ML and AI. However, it is not recommended because this might take huge time and your concepts of ML and AI might not be clear due to a lack of guidance.

Finally, it can be said that to achieve a machine learning job, you are required to have knowledge of programming, computer science, and statistics. However, the main challenge is identifying the right platform for learning the tools and techniques. If you are a working professional and aim to develop a career in this field, then it is recommended to go with Learnbay as it is the safest choice.

Thank you",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=1477743691757946,2023-09-01T15:39:25.254845+00:00,,149,Gourav Bansal,https://www.quora.com/profile/Gourav-Bansal-144
What machine learning theory do I need to know in order to be a successful machine learning practitioner?,"The list below probably isn't exhaustive, but contains the first things I thought of. So hopefully, they're the most important/fundamental ones!  (Although I'm sure I missed some.)

Statistical Learning Theory:

Overfitting [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting ] -- A central concept in machine learning is that of overfitting.  Roughly speaking, overfitting happens when you train a model that captures the idiosyncrasies of your training data.  A model that overfits to training data cannot generalize well to new unseen test examples, which is ultimately what we want most machine learning models to do.

Generalization error [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error ] -- One way to quantify overfitting is through generalization error.  Roughly speaking, generalization error measure the gap between the error on the training set versus the test set.  Thus, the larger the generalization error, the more the model is overfitting.

Bias–variance tradeoff [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff ] -- Sometimes, it's OK if the model you train overfits so long as the generalization error is not too large.  For example, if you train a complex model that achieves 0.2 error on the training set and 0.5 error on the test set, that might be desirable to a simple model that achieves 0.5 error on the training set and 0.6 error on the test set.  Even though the simple model overfits less, it was so simple that it still performs worse on the test set compared to a complex model that overfits more.  The bias-variance tradeoff is a way of reasoning about this issue: when does it make sense to use a more complex model even though it overfits more?

Empirical risk minimization [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization ] -- When most people think of machine learning, they're probably thinking of empirical risk minimization.  That is, they want a model that achieves low error on some training set.  However, it is important to keep in mind what the assumptions are of empirical risk minimization.  Most notably, that the training set is sampled independently from the test distribution you really care about.  If this assumption is violated, you can get machine learning models that don't behave in the way you want (cf. Algorithms and Bias: Q. and A. With Cynthia Dwork [ http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/upshot/algorithms-and-bias-q-and-a-with-cynthia-dwork.html?_r=0 ]).

Cross-validation (statistics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics) ] -- Typically, one cannot test on data that one trained on, one must split the existing data into training and test sets. However, this is statistically wasteful and also increases the variability since you aren't testing on every data point at your disposal.  Cross validation is a way of getting around that by rotating what's in the training vs test sets. 

Confidence interval [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval ] -- The most direct quantitative way to compare two models is by looking at their respective test errors (e.g., via cross validation).  However, how do we know if two numbers actually reflect meaningful differences between the two models or are just due to some spurious effects caused by a finite sample size?  Confidence intervals are the most common way to deal with this issue.

Statistical hypothesis testing [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing- ] -- A related concept to confidence intervals is statistical hypothesis testing.  The most common thing to use this for is answer whether two models have statistically distinguishable accuracies.  The way statistical hypothesis testing is typically implemented involves using confidence intervals and setting the size of the confidence intervals at an appropriate width w.r.t. the desired statistical significance level.

Bootstrapping (statistics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics) ] -- Another way of evaluating the variability of the model is via bootstrapping, which effectively samples from the training set with replacement to generate new training sets that are statistically similar to the original training set.


Statistical Modeling:

Metrics | Kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Metrics ] -- It's important to understand what your metric of choice is for whatever modeling problem you're solving.  For some tasks, you only care that your model can make good predictions at the top (e.g., ranking in web search), so a metric like precision@10 is appropriate there.

Regularization (mathematics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)#Regularization_in_statistics_and_machine_learning ] --  Regularization serves two purposes.  First, it is commonly used to control for overfitting so that the learned model is not too complex.  Second, different choices of regularization reflect different assumptions about what ""simple"" means.  For instance, using L1 regularization encourages sparsity in the trained model, and interprets simple as having few non-zero parameters.  On the other hand, using L2 regularization encourages the norm of the learned model to be low, and interprets simple as having a small magnitude.

Machine learning Types and Tasks [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Types_of_problems_and_tasks ] --  People often think of supervised learning when they think machine learning (and in fact most of the topics listed here are described through the lens of supervised learning).  But supervised learning is not the only learning setup.  Others include unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, transductive learning, etc.  It's important to understand what kind of learning problem you're dealing with.  If you would rather deal with the supervised learning problem, that often means throwing away data for which you do not have labels for.  Sometimes that's good, and sometimes that's not so good.

Correlation vs. causation [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation ] -- It's important to keep in mind when inspecting a learned model that many things learned by the model are purely correlation and should not be interpreted causally. 


Optimization:

Stochastic gradient descent [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent ] -- Most machine learning models are trained via some form of stochastic gradient descent.  It's generally useful to understand when different methods work well, so you can train your models more efficiently.

Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient Descent [ https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2013/04/01/acceleratedgradientdescent/ ] -- One important concept in gradient descent is momentum, of which Nesterov's method is arguably the most beautiful instance.  Momentum is typically extremely useful for speeding up training.
 
Convex analysis [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_analysis ] --  It's important to understand when your learning problem is convex versus non-convex.  Convex learning problems always converge to the same optimal model, so you don't have to be too careful about how you train (apart for speed considerations).  Non-convex learning problems can get stuck in local optima, and so the model you get back can vary greatly.  As such, it's often important to be careful about how you initialize the non-convex learning problem.


Linear Algebra:

Norm (mathematics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) ] -- Norms are used a lot in machine learning.  For instance, many regularization formulations are written as norms.  Understanding the behavior of different norms will help you in deciding which kind of regularization you want to impose.

Matrix_(mathematics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) ] -- A lot of times, data and models are expressed using matrices.  Sometimes, you can save a lot of computation time by being clever about how you order the matrix operations.  Other times, you can figure out how to transform your data into the format that some learning toolkit uses by using matrix transforms.  

The Statistical Whitening Transform [ https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/the-statistical-whitening-transform/ ] --  One particularly useful approach for standardizing your data is whitening.  It's good to understand what assumptions are built into whitening, so that you'll have a good sense of when whitening will and won't work.


Outlook:
These days, there are a lot of tools being developed that can automate away a lot of the issues described above, and will thus make machine learning more intuitive & easier to use for more people.  For example, many machine learning packages already do cross validation automatically.  However, those tools are far from perfect, and so having a solid grasp of the theoretical fundamentals will be very beneficial in the long run, because it'll allow you to more intelligently use and compose the existing tools to achieve whatever data modeling task you're trying to solve.",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=15094717,2015-08-27T06:58:07.621122+00:00,2015-09-02T14:55:38.309455+00:00,722,Yisong Yue,https://www.quora.com/profile/Yisong-Yue

Thank You!",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=1477743694254722,2023-09-12T13:25:52.980075+00:00,,152,Rajat Pandey,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rajat-Pandey-501
What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"Machine learning is a complex subject hence, it requires the knowledge of various tools and techniques. In general, it is recommended for ML engineers to know data science as well as software engineering competencies.

Here are some of the qualifications for machine learning positions:

 * Writing algorithms for searching, sorting, and optimizing, whereas being familiar with approximative algorithms as well. Plus, comprehending data structures such as stacks, graphs, trees as well as multidimensional arrays.
 * Data modeling, proficiency in probability, mathematics, statistics, and hypothesis testing as well as the ability to create evaluation strategies on predictive models.
 * Understanding of deep learning, dynamic programming, natural language processing, neural network designs, video processing, etc.
Familiarity with these topics is crucial, however, if you are new to this field, then it is recommended to opt for professional training. If you go for online learning, then Coursera and UpGrad are the right platforms for you.

 * Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification by Coursera - This course has good ratings and it is offered by industry professionals where you will be able to learn the basics of ML from scratch.
However, they do not offer career assistance.

 * Executive Post Graduate Programme in Machine Learning & AI by Upgrad - They have good course modules that can help you with your overall career development.
Plus the course duration is much less, yet they do not offer domain specializations.

As an alternative, you can look for the Advance AI and ML Program for Tech Professionals. This is because, it offers, dual-project training comprising 15+ real-time and capstone projects, which are done in experience innovation labs. The experience centers are instituted in Banglore, Pune, Hyderabad, and Delhi. As it is designed for working professionals, hence they have the hybrid mode of learning, where theories will be taught online and real-time projects will be taught offline in experience innovation labs. Lastly, IBM certification (with Course Completion, Project Completion, and Microsoft course Completion) and guaranteed job assistance with offline centers as well in cities like Banglore, Pune, Hyderabad, and Delhi.

Important: They give industry-specific training. Data science is a talent that can be learned in one industry. All of the projects are built on top of that domain. Sales, BFSI, oil and gas, marketing, and other businesses are among those that are accessible. As a result, you'll be able to pick where to direct your DS career.

All the best!",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=1477743690379644,2023-08-26T15:43:28.918185+00:00,,169,Nikhil Rastogi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nikhil-Rastogi-82
What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"A good introductory course in Machine Learning is the one offerd by Andrew Ng on coursera. Once done with that you should either go through Andrew's stanford course (all of it is available on youtube) or go through the machine learning course from caltech by Prof. Abu Mustafa (that's my favourite). These courses will give you a good breadth of knowledge. Pursue your interest from there on. There are plenty of resources/lectures on VideoLectures.NET - VideoLectures.NET [ http://videolectures.net ] and youtube. 

You should also develop some skills in python/c++/java and a stat package like octave/matlab/R. It is also good to know a little about data bases like MySql. A very good introduction to python is at

It is also good to have a basic knowledge about Hadoop.",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=9584359,2015-02-03T07:09:59.477993+00:00,,72,Ambarish Jash,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ambarish-Jash
What are the most important skills that are needed to get started in machine learning?,"Working on machine learning in the industry is really about merging stats knowledge and practical engineering skills within the particular problem domain. For example, working on recommendations for an e-commerce product would require you to understand the user problems around finding relevant products or services on the website and apply statistical modeling to that problem.

So the skills required to get started in machine learning depends on where you are coming from. If you are a software engineer, the skills to build would be an understanding of statistics fundamentals, knowledge of commonly used machine learning algorithms, and most importantly, developing proficiency in working with data - querying data from different data sources, manipulating the data and reasoning about the data.

If you are coming from a statistics or quantitative background, it would be great to focus on programming skills. Being proficient in one of the common DS languages (Python or R) is critical to executing on any data analysis and machine learning modeling tasks. Understanding and adopting good software engineering practices would be extremely valuable, e.g., learning the data systems that handle the data flow at your company, testing best practices, automating commonly used workflows as libraries.

Besides these, to me, the most crucial skill for applying machine learning in the industry is knowing how to take a business problem, understand where machine learning can be useful and cast the business problem as a machine learning problem. An example at DoorDash is using machine learning to improve delivery time predictions that impact the customer experience.",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=131939444,2019-04-04T22:04:51.433359+00:00,,45,Raghav Ramesh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Raghav-Ramesh

I recommend reading research papers in addition to watching talks and lectures. Google published a controversial paper on the value of data, for example.

What are the best talks/lectures related to big data/algorithms/machine learning?,"Adding a very recent talk by Yann LeCun (published today April 29 2017, actual talk was in March 2017) to the comprehensive list of links already present here in the other answers.

Perhaps one of the best talks on the subject, particularly for its breadth and detailed analysis/evaluation of the state of art.

Few highlights from the talk (1hr and 48 mins including Q&A at end)

 * a sketch of the breakthroughs that led to the resurgence of machine learning, in part from his own personal contribution (convnets) - may be informative even for those of us who have heard/read it many times (e.g. SVMs and convnets originated at the same time with its authors separated by a few rooms).
 * a candid admission, with examples, of why we are still a long way of when it comes to creating true intelligence - i.e. machines with world models that go beyond just answering questions at a children’s book level. Reference. Tracking the world state with recurrent entity networks [ https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJTKKKqeg ]. The need for a reasonable understanding of the world or “common sense” which is virtually non-existent in current models. Reference. What are the most promising consumer product areas for ML? [ https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-promising-consumer-product-areas-for-ML-Where-will-we-see-most-impressive-breakthroughs-in-next-2-3-yrs-cars-computer-vision-etc/answer/Ajit-Rajasekharan ]
 * His view that key to intelligence is predictive or unsupervised learning - i.e. a model that can be trained by just observing the world without being fed labeled data by humans.
 * 
 * He cites Hinton’s argument about the necessity for unsupervised learning in humans.
 * 
 * Our brains have about 10^14 synapses (learnable parameters) and we live for about 10^9 seconds. So we have lot more parameters than data. This motivates the idea that we must do a lot of unsupervised learning since the perceptual input (including proprioception - the sense of relative positions of various parts of body) is the only place where we can get 10^5 dimensions of constraint per second - AMA Geoffrey Hinton • MachineLearning [ https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2lmo0l/ama_geoffrey_hinton/ ]
 * Only our unsupervised perception of our environment can account for 10^5 dimensions of constraint per second - the information we get from language or teachers (our labeled data) is not enough.
 * To give a very crude reference point to the potential capacity of the brain - 10^5 dimensions /second - an unsupervised learning model, word2vec captures semantic relatedness of words in under 500 dimensions for a substantially large corpus (much larger than entire wikipedia).


 * His believes reinforcement learning has its value in certain tasks like games (e.g. AlphGo) but it doesn’t work so well in real life scenarios, where learning has to happen in real time - a model cannot afford to learn from many trials in real life. Towards the end of the talk in Q&A he explains in detail how AlphaGo really works and the role reinforcement learning played in its success.
 * He then introduces Adversarial learning as the most exciting idea in machine learning in last 10 years. Reference. Attacking Machine Learning with Adversarial Examples [ https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/ ]
 * 
 * The power of these learning models is the ability to predict the future in uncertain conditions.
 * They do reasonably well in some prediction tasks (predicting 5 frames into future given an input video stream - e.g. filling up the remaining view of an apartment given initial view. Things fall apart when prediction extends to 50 frames - indicating we still have ways to go).

 * Then in Q&A, questions range from broad borderline philosophical topics (what is consciousness, is the concern of machines taking over the world really warranted etc.) to very pragmatic ones like how power efficient current models are compared to our brains.
 * 
 * Yann says they are terrible compared to human brain - a typical GPU card’s compute power is about 10 Teraflops at ~200 watts power consumption. The brain on the other hand ( a low estimate) is 100,000 Teraflops at 25 watts power consumption. He suggests some engineering trade-offs that can bring down power consumption and still perform well for certain tasks (lower precision, avoiding movement of data to extent possible etc.) and are being pursued by many startups.
 * This particular analysis by Yann is reminiscent of an analysis/comparison Von Neumann dating back over 50 years ago, except Von Neumann compared computing units made up of vacuum tubes to neurons in the human brain Reference. Theory of self replicating automata - Von Neumann and Arthur brooks (completed after Von Neumann’s death) 1966 [ http://cba.mit.edu/events/03.11.ASE/docs/VonNeumann.pdf ]

________________________________________________


 * In his response to the last question, he discusses the current (dismal) status of virtual assistants and poses the question himself, “when will we have truly intelligent virtual assistants(not ones like Siri where it throws funny scripted answers when things get slightly complicated) that we can ask questions and not be frustrated because we can sense it truly understands” -
 * 
 * he mentions an intelligent virtual assistant experiment in Facebook (partly automated but largely handled by humans behind the scene) which revealed the fact that there is a long tail of very complicated things that people want out of virtual assistants, for which the technology doesn’t exist yet and his prediction is that it would at least take one decade if not more to get there.

2. Linked Lists
3. Strings
4. Stacks
5. Queues
Understand their basic operations (insert, delete, search, traversal) and their complexity - Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet [ http://bigocheatsheet.com/ ], and code them all.

How do I learn big data technologies?,"I'll try to give a very crude overview of how the pieces fit in together, because the details span multiple books. Please forgive me for some oversimplifications.

 * MapReduce is the Google paper that started it all (Page on googleusercontent.com [ http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf ]). It's a paradigm for writing distributed code inspired by some elements of functional programming. You don't have to do things this way, but it neatly fits a lot of problems we try to solve in a distributed way. The Google internal implementation is called MapReduce and Hadoop is it's open-source implementation. Amazon's Hadoop instance is called Elastic MapReduce (EMR) and has plugins for multiple languages.
 * HDFS is an implementation inspired by the Google File System [ http://research.google.com/archive/gfs.html ] (GFS) to store files across a bunch of machines when it's too big for one. Hadoop consumes data in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
 * Apache Spark is an emerging platform that has more flexibility than MapReduce but more structure than a basic message passing interface. It relies on the concept of distributed data structures (what it calls RDDs) and operators. See this page for more: The Apache Software Foundation [ http://apache.org ] 
 * Because Spark is a lower level thing that sits on top of a message passing interface, it has higher level libraries to make it more accessible to data scientists. The Machine Learning library built on top of it is called MLib and there's a distributed graph library called GraphX.
 * Pregel and it's open source twin Giraph is a way to do graph algorithms on billions of nodes and trillions of edges over a cluster of machines. Notably, the MapReduce model is not well suited to graph processing so Hadoop/MapReduce are avoided in this model, but HDFS/GFS is still used as a data store.
 * Zookeeper is a coordination and synchronization service that a distributed set of computer make decisions by consensus, handles failure, etc.
 * Flume and Scribe are logging services, Flume is an Apache project and Scribe is an open-source Facebook project. Both aim to make it easy to collect tons of logged data, analyze it, tail it, move it around and store it to a distributed store.
 * Google BigTable and it's open source twin HBase were meant to be read-write distributed databases, originally built for the Google Crawler that sit on top of GFS/HDFS and MapReduce/Hadoop. Google Research Publication: BigTable [ http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html ]
 * Hive and Pig are abstractions on top of Hadoop designed to help analysis of tabular data stored in a distributed file system (think of excel sheets too big to store on one machine). They operate on top of a data warehouse, so the high level idea is to dump data once and analyze it by reading and processing it instead of updating cells and rows and columns individually much. Hive has a language similar to SQL while Pig is inspired by Google's Sawzall - Google Research Publication: Sawzall [ http://research.google.com/archive/sawzall.html ]. You generally don't update a single cell in a table when processing it with Hive or Pig.
 * Hive and Pig turned out to be slow because they were built on Hadoop which optimizes for the volume of data moved around, not latency. To get around this, engineers bypassed and went straight to HDFS. They also threw in some memory and caching and this resulted in Google's Dremel (Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets [ http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html ]), F1 (F1 - The Fault-Tolerant Distributed RDBMS Supporting Google's Ad Business [ http://research.google.com/pubs/pub38125.html ]), Facebook's Presto (Presto | Distributed SQL Query Engine for Big Data [ http://prestodb.io/ ]), Apache Spark SQL (Page on apache.org [ http://spark.incubator.apache.org/and ] ), Cloudera Impala (Cloudera Impala: Real-Time Queries in Apache Hadoop, For Real [ http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/cloudera-impala-real-time-queries-in-apache-hadoop-for-real/ ]), Amazon's Redshift, etc. They all have slightly different semantics but are essentially meant to be programmer or analyst friendly abstractions to analyze tabular data stored in distributed data warehouses.
 * Mahout (Scalable machine learning and data mining [ https://mahout.apache.org/ ]) is a collection of machine learning libraries written in the MapReduce paradigm, specifically for Hadoop. Google has it's own internal version but they haven't published a paper on it as far as I know.

 * Oozie is a workflow scheduler. The oversimplified description would be that it's something that puts together a pipeline of the tools described above. For example, you can write an Oozie script that will scrape your production HBase data to a Hive warehouse nightly, then a Mahout script will train with this data. At the same time, you might use pig to pull in the test set into another file and when Mahout is done creating a model you can pass the testing data through the model and get results. You specify the dependency graph of these tasks through Oozie (I may be messing up terminology since I've never used Oozie but have used the Facebook equivalent).

 * Lucene is a bunch of search-related and NLP tools but it's core feature is being a search index and retrieval system. It takes data from a store like HBase and indexes it for fast retrieval from a search query. Solr uses Lucene under the hood to provide a convenient REST API for indexing and searching data. ElasticSearch is similar to Solr.
 * Sqoop is a command-line interface to back SQL data to a distributed warehouse. It's what you might use to snapshot and copy your database tables to a Hive warehouse every night.
 * Hue is a web-based GUI to a subset of the above tools - http://gethue.com/

That destruction could take the form of either an oligarchy with tools and grasp exceeding Orwell’s 1984, or societal collapse.

Will technology save the human race or destroy it?,"This is called a “false dilemma fallacy”. It could just be both!

Nobody can predict the future. There aren’t even any respectable, intelligent odds. I think it’s likely that we won’t destroy ourselves. Barring nuclear war (not gonna happen), or some pandemic engineered in a lab (not anytime soon), we possess just enough technology and smarts to stay ahead of any foreseeable event except maybe a giant meteor strike, gamma ray burster or some kind of a solar flare.

Evolution cannot keep up with our technological advancement and it’s had billions of years to adapt an ecophage and hasn’t. No virus has ever evolved that can kill all human beings everywhere, largely because —believe it or not— we’ve got a really great immune system. Even when that fails us, our current technology —which says nothing about the hyper advanced computers that are only getting more powerful— can develop treatments much faster than nature apparently comes up with diseases.

Sure. Five years from now, some zombie could have eaten my tasty brains, having been infected with the Rage Virus. I guess it’s possible but that is highly, highly, HIGHLY unlikely to happen. We are smart. We tend to develop technology as pressures in the environment dictate. Oceans rise? Big problem. Horrible. But we’re likely to funnel technology —ignoring automated construction tech, that isn’t that far into the future (say, 2050), bottoming out costs— into building sea walls around the really important places and just moving people inland.

Some fungus that eats all the crops? Genetic engineering to make a new one. All the bees die? We genetically tailor a crop or new bees. Genetic engineering may kill us all one day, I accept that. But more than likely, we’ll dump the funds into whatever technology holds the hope of resolving whatever problem we get ourselves into. This seems to always be the case: we invent the next tech to solve the problems created by the previous one.

One day, we will cease existing. We will not endure forever. That’s just not possible based on how we understand the cosmos. Even if we endure 800 quintillion years, we will still perish in year 800 quintillion and 1. Nothing lasts forever. So if we endure a century or a trillion-trillion-trillion-trillion-trillion-trillion-trillion-trillion centuries, we will still die. Maybe from our technology, maybe from the Sun burning its fuel, maybe from the heat death of the cosmos. I don’t think it’ll be from technology.

"If technology is liberating, what does it free us from?","""Technology"" is just a word for objects and systems that make certain jobs easier. A pencil is a technology that makes writing easier (e.g. you don't need ink) and email is technology that makes written-at-a-distance communication easier. 

Technology changes the world, and change isn't necessarily liberating or binding. It's often both. Sometimes a technology liberates people one way but binds them in another way. Email frees me from lines at the post office but keeps me shackled to my computer. Sometimes a technology liberates one class of people while binding another. Coal liberated many from having to chop wood in the winter while trapping others in coal mines. 

There are few universal or general statements one can make about ""technology,"" because it doesn't really exist. What exists are individual tools: pencils, wheels, tooth brushes, toilets, garbage cans, trucks, atomic bombs, x-ray machines, saran wrap, DVD players, bandages, microprocessors, shoes, etc. Each has caused specific changes and each has liberated or bound us in a variety of ways. 

Is paper liberating?

What about the gas chambers in Nazi death camps? 

""Technology"" is just an umbrella term -- one that is useful to a point. But if we want to say anything specific, we need to at least narrow things down to a class of technology, such as ""communications"" or ""food preparation.""

Anyone who answers this question in a simple way, saying ""It's liberating, because..."" or something similar, is likely thinking about a specific technology or group of technologies used in specific contexts, even if he's not explicit about what he means. 

I've found that when I say ""technology"" to people, they tend to think, ""You know, like iPhones and stuff.""

Is technology advancing too fast for humanity to cope?,"You’re asking the key question of the 21st century here. But it’s not technology advancing too fast that is the whole dilemma. Rather than giving you the full-blown lecture, I’ll boil it down.

The story of mankind has been technological effect outpacing human institutional ability to adapt quickly enough. Whether that institution is governmental, religious, economic, military, or a combination thereof — societies, cultures and their institutions do not adapt as fast as technology creates change. Bad things often result.

38,000,000 casualties in World War I, because of some outdated imperial treaties, a few anarchist kooks and technologically advanced warfare.

Students of history and anyone at a military academy learn this over and over. It’s why the US pours so much money into military tech. So this little truth about humanity is not a secret. Not since the Mongols perfected archery on horseback, or Europe got ahold of Chinese gunpowder.

The problem we’re running into is this:

Rate of Change has been increasing, as the complexity and power of our technology has been increasing. You’ve probably noticed. Atomic bombs. Petro-economics, politics and climate change. Robotics, IT, AI and cultural norms about human employment. The list goes on.

Now the other problem: Technology is helping humans live longer. Much longer. Used to be, we could count on the elders being replaced and thus allowing institutions to adapt somewhat fast enough to keep up with technology.

You see where I’m going here: Increasing Rate of Change (and scope of change, now that we’re globally connected) is bumping right into cohorts of people who are living longer, thinking in the past, and exacerbating humanity’s age-old dilemma.

We do have some smart people who are aware of this “institutional lag” problem. It’s largely religious and political institutions that are the worst laggards, along with the cultural and economic forces that underpin them.

It might seem like we’re having trouble coping today, but the previous five centuries were much, much worse. We just need to keep a handle on the climate change issue, not let the WMD’s get loose, and make sure our growing population has enough fresh water, shelter, and food.

Easy, right?",https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-liberate-mankind?top_ans=25263479,2016-07-17T05:51:47.033712+00:00,2023-09-15T15:36:47.810203+00:00,34,Anonymous,

Is AI an existential threat to humanity?,"First…Stop it.

Artificial intelligence is not ""intelligence"". And it's not ""artificial consciousness"".

Everyone is afraid that AI will suddenly wake up, get upset, and take over the world.

Or that AI will wake up and take all of our jobs. This will happen. But without the ""wake up"" part.

Below I describe what real AI is.

If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.

Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.

---------

A) STATISTICS

Statistics is at the heart of most AI programs.

Just like statistics is at the heart of a lot of human decision making.

For instance, if you see clouds in the sky, your brain thinks: ""Hmmm, the last 100 times I saw clouds this dark, it usually meant it was about to rain"".

When you think like that, you are using statistics to make the decision: ""I should _probably_ go inside now.""

I'll give an AI example: Siri or Alexa. How does Alexa understand the words you just said?

In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.

One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:

It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).

When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.

If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.

Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".

There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.

Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""

It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.

Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""

It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".

Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.

Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".

In other words, it ""learned"".

So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.

Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.

Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.

-----

B) EVALUATION FUNCTION

I just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?

Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?

How does it get from point A to point B?

1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.

2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )

But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.

3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.

4) Start driving.

5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.

6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )

If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.

If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.

If it's blank space it will just keep going.

If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.

In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).

Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.

Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.

When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.

The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.

-----

C) TREES

The hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.

But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.

And yet Google did it.

For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.

A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.

A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.

And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.

Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.

That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.

And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.

It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.

D) HARDWARE

Everybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.

How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?

This turned out to be wrong.

The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.

Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.

What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.

Both related to hardware.

a. Computers got faster. 
b. First the creators of Deep Blue developed software. But then they made the software into hardware, building the logic right into the hardware infrastructure of the computer. Making the program 100x faster than it would have been.

And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.

Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.

As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".

[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]

INTERLUDE

What I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.

The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.

-----

E) STATISTICS + TREE

Remember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.

Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.

First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?

At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.

He ended up building the world champion of Othello.

He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.

He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).

Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.

If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.

That program became the world champion of Othello.

AlphaGo took it one step further.

It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.

It used faster hardware to speed up the process.

Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".

Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion

------

That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.

Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.

How would the bank lend money?

Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:

- their age
- where they grew up
- what their job is, are they married? 
- are they divorced? do they have kids? 
- How often do they move? how have they done on prior loans like this? and I even know what they buy on Amazon and how often they fly to Las Vegas.

I can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".

Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.

And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!

---

Let's say I want to fight terrorists.

I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.

I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.

And so on.

I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.

Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.

----

This is all that AI is.

It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.

Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):

- statistics has gotten better
- methods of building the trees have gotten better (this was the subject of some of my research when I was in graduate school)
- hardware has gotten faster
- more data is available about everything.

What is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.

It's data.

I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of) bit.ly [ https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F&h=AT3orGSwD27WWXcfNXOHYJT0fOlnbBcd09o-VTkqcool3TKr48HWxNENlGOPP6lIfwsStbD5Wf7coWSceGuXu4VLQTVAJtAj-Q-2ke-ur9MTAM23hnj0a_5zbrkqQhb9TrGsoLpl-pGplBVeF60t_yvCiN66VqBvRYQ0_xDtDkrxwyBg_gN_-TtTlSUZ6SxG4hwtOA41HAKFNXUZ8FLWvNqsywTK9jtKXcnOHM07XQUsDPz_zK2kuuD2y3Co3nXT3AKcvuqHp8yxH32IXkvumgJQW8tNnMLm8UNbKI0wQaXKzCVp09YD460Pz4LL8hlV5jz1zcZQaWgBTn-nDaEpvTiwmY-URZ2GkqasxK75 ], as an example. bit.ly [ https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F&h=AT0lhT5PDHPHSEeypFdJU2oliY61fKhCFq3VQNdtUb7zjGXHzJqFHFSI7ixaicN-wB79C_501XLqdAbfXuYrJc5fgV3tD_9VI6Rco0iKt-FqEHsvYQTKNPM5JIv0uzLszxVib1011tImkDOu7J5WhRI4V6KIv_7z-LZkWZ-N3Dv2BOF1lN_Wh3dChh87uU85kU9q0b-5OiIIOqf56rmWDTtCSQjKPmPkTaMlinknTvFbmnnyTyC0Ebyi4eBK6Wk5snRDNgf3eNlgU7ta19FqLeC3fEt1vfSqZFFyo7ttvva9FAbwcBU4MurvnutxRX_DBDZE45vNs7ygP4ZzyZEwHPYN9GEJM3XAmg ] accounts for about 2-5% of all Internet traffic.

Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.

And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.

But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.

Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.

Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".

Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.

Where will humans still be unique?

I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.


BUT… will AI replace jobs?

The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.

Look at recent examples:

A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.

Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.

B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.

Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.

Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.

Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.

C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)

Final conclusion:

 * AI will probably create a “have” and “have not” situation, particularly as humans start to use AI to increase mental and physical capacity
This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.

 * AI will not destroy as many jobs
Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.

 * We can’t predict. ATMs didn’t destroy bank tellers. VCRs didn’t destroy movie theaters. Spotify/Pandora/etc did destroy music stores and record sales but that was replaced by growing revenues in music tours.
 * Education needs to scale up. AI, programming, and the higher-end jobs that will be created need to be studied. College is not the place to study these opportunities. Instead: Khan Academy, Lynda, CodeAcademy, Coursera, etc should become accredited and get people ready for the opportunities that will arise.

Is AI an existential threat to humanity?,"AI generated images are one of the scariest things I can imagine. They may eventually render all photographic evidence obsolete. Can you imagine the effect that could have on the criminal justice system? Photography and film is about to all be inadmissable in court. AI generated content is notoriously bad at hands, for some reason.

They can manage faces, typically, and they can manage bodies decently enough. But hands? They suck at them. It’s fairly easily for a thief to wear a fake finger, or two, and make it appear he has an extra digit. It’ll throw juries for a loop, no doubt. And since “deepfakes” are now a thing, you make anyone say anything, do anything…

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIQ4lf6vkJo
What to make of voices? AI can make pre-recorded voices say anything. You can make Arnold Schwarzenegger sing Whitney Houston. Or Celine Dion. Or have him play in Titanic. But, less innocently… you could have him say horribly racist or criminal things, too. Or admit to things he didn’t do, things he never said. And people can do that with anyone.

So while I wouldn’t say AI is necessarily an existential threat to us as a species… it can definitely be a massive disruption to our society. It’s the ultimate culmination of the “post truth era”… in a world where anyone is already eager to dismiss any unfavorable story as ‘fake news’, AI makes it a million times easier to do so.

Is technology liberating us or imprisoning us?,"It is both. The classic example to consider is mobile phone. Let’s first look at around 2005. Phones are not yet smart enough, but calling and texting is there.

Many people at this time decided not to have mobile phone yet, since they saw it as improsoning. “Why I should be available 24/7 and do not have any privacy”.

Hovewer, for those who decided to have mobile phones at that time it was liberating , since they could call any place they want at any time they want.

With smart phones getting more and more sophisticated and having functionalities of gps, camera, etc. in 2018 it hard to believe it is improsoning anymore, especially if you can set-up privacy settings in way that you are not getting unwanted contacts.

With social networks, hovewer, the trend is somewhat opposite. At first communicating with few dozen of friends on Facebook and meeting new people was liberating. Now when someone has 1000 friends and actively communicates with 100 -it is clearly improsoning; especially if you would like a meaningfull commucation out of that.

Let’s measure liberation/imprisonment by a single metrics to be consistent. And the most appropriate metrics would be time. Then, liberation would mean that technology allows to save your time, while imprisonment means it eats your time over time",https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-liberate-mankind?top_ans=100527095,2018-09-21T15:44:14.674918+00:00,,3,Leonid Naimark,https://www.quora.com/profile/Leonid-Naimark

What amazing things can Python do?,"Function decorators are particularly neat in Python. They allow you to enhance the functionality of existing functions.

Let me demonstrate with a simple example of calculating the factorial of a number recursively:

[code]def factorial(n):
   if n == 0:
      return 1
   return n * factorial(n - 1)
[/code]One way to speed up this function is to use Memoization [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization ]. Using decorators, this can be easily achieved:

[code]def memoize(f):
   cache = {}

   def inner(n):
      if n not in cache:
         cache[n] = f(n)
      return cache[n]

   return inner

@memoize
def factorial(n):
   if n == 0:
      return 1
   return n * factorial(n - 1)
[/code]One call to factorial results in the cache building up for all numbers %3C n. Next time you invoke factorial for a number %3C n, the result is not computed but fetched from the cache. This makes it easy to separate out the cache maintaining logic from the function being decorated. 

@memoize is syntactic sugar for:

[code]factorial = memoize(factorial)
[/code]To make the memoize function more general (the way I use it often):

[code]def memoize(f):
    cache = {}

    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = f(*args, **kwargs)
        return cache[args]

    inner.__name__ = 'memoized_' + f.__name__
    return inner
[/code]This makes it possible to use it for functions with different number and types of arguments. The arguments that should be the cache key must be passed positionally (normally) while the others should be named arguments. Any mutable objects should also be passed as named arguments because Python doesn't allow mutable dictionary keys. To illustrate with an example:

[code]@memoize
def find_path(source, graph=graph, path=[]):
...
[/code]Here, graph and path are passed as named arguments.

The line below renames the ""name"" attribute of the function with the name of the actual function being decorated. This is helpful for debugging because the value of __name__ is printed in a stack trace. There is actually a library function (functools.wraps) that does this.

[code]inner.__name__ = 'memoized_' + f.__name__
[/code]

This is just one example of how function decorators in Python can be used. Another quick example for the web developers:

[code]@requires_login
def home_page():
...
[/code]This way you can separate the logic for user authentication from the view rendering functions.

Update : 10216. 

Last night, I lost interest in everything and was looking for some new ways to kill time.  And as I was thinking, something struck me like a thunder striking a lonely tree in a desert! I played the Snake game a lot as a kid and ever since I took Computer Science I wanted to write this game. I knew that the logistics were simple but every time I start something used to get in way. But last night, that didn't happen. So, I sat straight from 9PM to 5:10 AM in the morning and completed writing the code. It was one of the yureka moments of my life. I used a specialized module in python called Pygame. 

+1 for Pygame. And I am looking forward to write more of my childhood fantasy games. 

Here is the link to the code if someone wants to give it a try. 

rajiv256/Pygames [ https://github.com/rajiv256/Pygames/tree/master/Snake ] 

I did it in Linux and I just had to install pygame and run the .py file as a regular file on the command line. 

To install Pygame from command line :



%3E sudo apt-get install python-pygame

What are some interesting things to do with Python? I want to make something related to big data or machine learning.,"You just learned Python and immediately want to start on machine learning or big data? I won't try to talk you out of it.

Kaggle  [ http://kaggle.com/ ]is a great place to start a pre-fabricated machine learning project. Don't expect any new and remarkable results though.

If you want to do something that hasn't been done a thousand times, consider getting some data from Factual [ http://factual.com ]. Factual has a nice API and offers large free data sets (limited query rate of 10,000 per day). The query limit precludes you from doing BIG data too soon, but you can accumulate it over time or just settle for medium-sized data. You can get all sorts of information on places all around the world. Some that information is actually generated using machine learning algorithms, like “existence”: the probability a place currently exists. You could:

1. try to recreate their “existence” score. This will be pretty difficult, but is definitely machine learning.
2. study patterns in the names of places. This is more data-oriented, but has plenty of extensions into ML.
3. determine what type of restaurant is most popular in each area (obviously NYC will be different from a small town in Kentucky). Type would be a combination of cuisine, price, etc… Factual has all the data you'd need to do this.
4. examine whether the length of a place’s name has a large effect on its popularity. Obviously if it has a name that takes 5 minutes to say, word of mouth advertising won't do much good. But if the name is too short it may be common and get confused with other places. What's the perfect length? Factual has a “PlaceRank” which is a measure of popularity you could use for this.
5. Determine which airports have the hungriest people. By that, I mean the airports with the most meals purchased per person passing through.
6. ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT! The dataset is huge and very well documented and maintained. There are countless things you can do with it.

What amazing things can Python do?,"Thanks for the A2A.

I always wanted to write into this topic, but never had the courage to do it, so here it comes.

Alot of answers here use the Standard Library to show the power of python. Some other use specific modules/libraries to show projects that can be done with python.

I am a big fan of python packages, I am collecting them like others do collect pennies, because I think thats the most awesome part of Python. So, what I am going to do is 2 parts. Showing some secrets of commonly used libraries and then presenting some libraries that are not so well known.

1. youtube-dl
Okay, nearly everyone has heard of youtube-dl. Everyone uses it to download youtube videos, which is alot better than other options (websites with ads, programs that install other software on the computer)

What most dont know or dont realize: it doesnt stop at youtube. youtube-dl can deal with alot of websites, like bbc, clipfish etc. The question is rather, what CANT youtube-dl deal with? youtube-dl: Supported sites [ https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html ] 

2. Using Python to solve your polynomials? NO WAY

Forget wolfram alpha, you have python!

[code]from numpy import poly1d
p = poly1d([3, 2, 1]) 
print(p) #3x²+2x+1
print(p(2)) #plugs in 2 for x =%3E 17
print(p([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) #[ 6 17 34 57 86]
print(p*p) # 9x^4 + 12 x^3 + 10 x^2 + 4 x + 1
print(p.deriv()) # 6 x + 2
print(p.r) #shows the roots of the equation.
[/code]More informations here:

numpy.poly1d - NumPy v1.10 Manual [ http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.poly1d.html ] 

3. Want to easily do Sentiment Analysis? Use Textblob! 

Why do you want to reinvent the wheel? There are so many useful libraries out there that do exactly what you want!



[code]from textblob import TextBlob
print(TextBlob(""I am  happy that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am very happy that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am not  happy that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am not very happy that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am sad that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am very sad that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am not sad that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am not very sad that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
#results
#Sentiment(polarity=0.8, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=1.0, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=-0.4, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=-0.3076923076923077, subjectivity=0.7692307692307692)
#Sentiment(polarity=-0.5, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=-0.65, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=0.25, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=0.1923076923076923, subjectivity=0.7692307692307692)
[/code]4. Every wanted to find out how close 2 strings are without being equal? Or find out the closest match?

Enter fuzzywuzzy!

[code]%3E%3E%3E fuzz.ratio(""this is a test"", ""this is a test!"")
    96
%3E%3E%3E fuzz.partial_ratio(""this is a test"", ""this is a test!"")
    100
%3E%3E%3E choices = [""Atlanta Falcons"", ""New York Jets"", ""New York Giants"", ""Dallas Cowboys""]
%3E%3E%3E process.extract(""new york jets"", choices, limit=2)
    [('New York Jets', 100), ('New York Giants', 78)]
%3E%3E%3E process.extractOne(""cowboys"", choices)
    (""Dallas Cowboys"", 90)
[/code]Examples from here: seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy [ https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy ] 

5. Everyone knows regular expressions. Did you know that you can easily generate String that fit the regular expression?



[code]%3E%3E%3E import exrex

%3E%3E%3E exrex.getone('(ex)r\\1')
'exrex'

%3E%3E%3E list(exrex.generate('((hai){2}|world!)'))
['haihai', 'world!']

%3E%3E%3E exrex.getone('\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}-[0-9]{4}')
'3096-7886-2834-5671'

%3E%3E%3E exrex.getone('(1[0-2]|0[1-9])(:[0-5]\d){2} (A|P)M')
'09:31:40 AM'

%3E%3E%3E exrex.count('[01]{0,9}')
1023

%3E%3E%3E print '\n'.join(exrex.generate('This is (a (code|cake|test)|an (apple|elf|output))\.'))
This is a code.
This is a cake.
This is a test.
This is an apple.
This is an elf.
This is an output.

%3E%3E%3E print exrex.simplify('(ab|ac|ad)')
(a[bcd])

What are some amazing things you can do with Python?,"There is a non-exhaustive list of amazing things that you can do with python there is so much you can do.

some most amazing things include...

Creating  a file server with just 

[code]python -m SimpleHTTPServer #default port 8080
[/code]this line creates  file server, now any device that is on the network can access files from your P.C. I do it all the times when i have to shift some movies to my mobile ,i can browse my whole computer from my mobile. 

Here are some screenshots

This is my PC

and here's my phone,full access to every folder


this is amazing..

Some other things that i've managed to do keeping file in Well Organised manner. I am really very bad at keeping files in their correct folder, after a week or two there is   chaos but what i managed to do was create a script that can take files and keep them in their respective folders like all images in one folder,python files in another, office files and so on with just one click. some screeshots...

Before

After file_organiser.py(you can see it ) was clicked

Now, automating daily life things are other field where python performs better and can surely be amazing. like i am currently working on this one , reading all the movie   files names( i have an movies folder) and downloading all information about it from imdb which include story line, cast, reviews and rating and saving them alongside movies. you can do this all with python. 

Cricket score notification is yet another amazing thing for which you can write a script and i've also did so. it just pops up the score after a period of time. libraries like beautifulsoup are such a great help in these cases.(screenshots are not available because that script is in ubuntu (i've dual booted the system) i will edit the answer later).


Want to read zen of python: just do this

[code]%3E%3E%3Eimport this
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit. 
Simple is better than complex. 
Complex is better than complicated. 
Flat is better than nested. 
Sparse is better than dense. 
Readability counts. 
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. 
Although practicality beats purity. 
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. 
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. 
Now is better than never. 
Although never is often better than *right* now. 
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. 
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

What are some interesting things to do with Python? I want to make something related to big data or machine learning.,"The author of this content is: Mr. Praveen Kumar.

A few years ago, when I was in college, I attended a workshop organized by FOSSEE [ http://python.fossee.in/ ] and it was in this workshop that I met ""Python"" and fell in love with her at first sight. I was amazed at how easy it was to write simple solutions to complex problems in Python. One of the utility I learnt at the workshop was an image to ASCII art generator.

How it works?

We scale a given image to a standard resolution that suitably represents the ASCII version of a given image. The scaled version is then converted to a grayscale image. In a grayscale image, there are 256 shades of gray, or in other words, each pixel carries only the intensity information which is represented by an 8 bit value. A pixel with a value of 0 is assumed to be black and the one with 255 is assumed to be white. We divide the whole range of 0-255 into 11 smaller ranges of 25 pixels each and then assign each pixel a character according to the range it falls in. The point is to assign a group of pixels with slightly varying intensity the same ASCII char. We use the PIL library to play with the images. The code given below is almost self explanatory. The default char mapping and resolution doesn't render good ASCII arts for every image size and so you should try modifying the char mapping and image size to the one that best represents the given image.

Here are some ASCII arts:

Dependencies:

PIL(Python Imaging Library)

Under Ubuntu

[code]$ sudo pip install Pillow

[code]ASCII_CHARS = [ '#', '?', '%', '.', 'S', '+', '.', '*', ':', ',', '@']

    """"""
    (original_width, original_height) = image.size
    aspect_ratio = original_height/float(original_width)
    new_height = int(aspect_ratio * new_width)

    new_image = image.resize((new_width, new_height))
    return new_image

def convert_to_grayscale(image):
    return image.convert('L')

def map_pixels_to_ascii_chars(image, range_width=25):
    """"""Maps each pixel to an ascii char based on the range
    in which it lies.

    0-255 is divided into 11 ranges of 25 pixels each.
    """"""

    pixels_in_image = list(image.getdata())
    pixels_to_chars = [ASCII_CHARS[pixel_value/range_width] for pixel_value in
            pixels_in_image]

    return """".join(pixels_to_chars)

def convert_image_to_ascii(image, new_width=100):
    image = scale_image(image)
    image = convert_to_grayscale(image)

    pixels_to_chars = map_pixels_to_ascii_chars(image)
    len_pixels_to_chars = len(pixels_to_chars)

    image_ascii = [pixels_to_chars[index: index + new_width] for index in
            xrange(0, len_pixels_to_chars, new_width)]

    return ""\n"".join(image_ascii)

    image = None
    try:
        image = Image.open(image_filepath)
    except Exception, e:
        print ""Unable to open image file {image_filepath}."".format(image_filepath=image_filepath)
        print e
        return

"What are some real-life projects that can be made with Python? To prevent confusion on what I mean by “real-life projects”, this is generally what I mean: Projects that can be used to do real tasks.","One day I was driving back from work and I wanted to know which movies where playing at the theater near my house. So, I did the search on my phone and it took me about 5 to 7 minutes to find the movies that were playing on that day. I hate searching my phone while driving because now I have to “Multi Task” and worry about not wrecking the car. So, I thought why not write a program that will send me one text message everyday with details of the movies (name, date playing, show timings ). So, I wrote first part of the program that goes to the website and parse the information that I want and store it in Json format. Now all I have to do is use Twilio API and have it send to my phone and add a cron job.

Here the code, just in case you are interested. You will need to download PhantomJs and put it in the same directory as this file.

This is just a small example and what you can do is limited to your imagination:)

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from selenium import webdriver

data = {}

browser = webdriver.PhantomJS(""./phantomjs.exe"")
browser.get('http://www.galaxytheatres.com/Browsing/Cinemas/Details/3')

# Parse html
soup = BeautifulSoup(browser.page_source, ""html.parser"")
gData = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'film-showtimes'})

# Total number of movies
movieTotal = len([movie.text for movie in soup.find_all('h3', {'class': 'film-title'})])

for i in range(movieTotal):
    # Get movie name
    movieTitle = gData[i].find('h3', {'class': 'film-title'}).text

    # Get date when movie is showing
    movieDate = gData[i].find('h4', {'class': 'session-date'}).text
    movieDate = movieDate.split(',')[1].strip()

    # Get movie Timings
    timing = list(gData[i].find('div', {'class': 'session-times'}))
    timing = [element for element in timing if element != '\n']
    movieTiming = [time.find('time').text for time in timing]

    # Storing everything in json format
    data.update({i: {'name': movieTitle, 'date': movieDate, 'timing': movieTiming}})

# Sorting dictionary by date
sortedData = sorted(data.values(), key=itemgetter('date'))

# Converting [ {}, {} ] to { {}, {} }
jsonData = {i:item for i, item in enumerate(sortedData)}

# Writing dictionary to .json file

Get's the size (height and width) of the image, hash it MD5, SHA256 and delete the file. Save information in the database - don't download it again. Gather more information like country of origin etc

Run the program for a week. Without it crashing!

Then write a program to extract some statistics about what you have found. Where did you go in the crawl? How many files found? How many Unique? Average size of image? etc etc etc

What are some interesting things to do with Python? I want to make something related to big data or machine learning.,"Python allows you to do many cool things. Do you want to build a website with a backend , Python has Django/Flask to support it. Do you want to build a GUI application(i.e a desktop app) , Python has pyQt/Tkinter for it. Do you want to predict stocks for the next few days based on the previous years data, Python has scikit-learn for it. Do you want to take screenshots of 100 webpages without visiting them manually , python has Selenium for it. The applications are endless. I will list down some of the famous libraries and their applications.

1. Web development :- You can develop a website with a backend supporting REST api using python frameworks such as Django / Flask.

2. Game development :- You can develop a video game using module Pygame.

3. Computer Vision :- You can do interesting things such as Face detection, Color detection using Opencv with python

4. Web scraping :- Want to get data from a website but the website doesn't have an api to expose data? You can use scraping. Most of the News aggregators, e-commerce price comparison websites such as buyhatke do web scraping.Python has Requests, BeautifulSoup , Scrapy to support web scraping.

5. Machine Learning :- You can do cool things such as predicting stocks, finger print identification, spam detection etc. using machine learning. Python has modules scikit-learn , theano, tensorflow to support it. Currently Deep Learning is all the hype and Tensorflow has support for Deep Learning.

6. GUI development :- To develop a cross-platform desktop application python can be used. Python has modules Tkinter, PyQt to support it.

7. Robotics :- Raspberry pi can be used as a brain to the robot to perform various actions and to react to the environment and the coding on a Raspberry pi can be done using python.

8. Data Analysis :- Data whenever obtained either online or offline would not be properly formatted with various issues such as missing values etc. This data can be cleaned using Pandas. And to find patterns from the data Matplotlib can be used in visualizing the data. These are used as a first step in machine learning before applying any ML algo.

9. Browser Automation :- Cool things such as opening a browser and posting a fb status can be done using Selenium with python.

1. A script that go into my download folder every hours and tidy up everything, order by resolution, by names, removes known bad files, etc (first script I did, I was a student back then, ugliest code I’ve ever written, but still works :p)
2. A script that scan a whole folder and subfolders and will tell you exactly what modifications where made later
3. a script that retieve from my 3d scanner 21 pictures, order them, if one of the camera failed it uses the timestamp meta data to know in what scan the pictures is suposed to be, make photo preview, etc
4. A bot that bypass captcha using a OCR librairy and request a lot from bitcoin faucet :p, I gave up however, too high maintenance for too little gain.
5. A funny name generator : 40 names, huhdreds of adjectives, you get suff like combat-butterfly, stealth-cannibal, chemical-octopus, I use it everytime I need a name somewhere, around 21000 unique names

Understanding the underscore( _ ) of Python!

There are 5 cases for using the underscore in Python.

1. For storing the value of last expression in interpreter.
2. For ignoring the specific values. (so-called “I don’t care”)
3. To give special meanings and functions to name of vartiables or functions.
4. To use as ‘Internationalization(i18n)’ or ‘Localization(l10n)’ functions.
5. To separate the digits of number literal value.
Let’s look at each case.

When used in interpreter

The python interpreter stores the last expression value to the special variable called ‘_’. This feature has been used in standard CPython interpreter first and you could use it in other Python interpreters too.

For Ignoring the values

The underscore is also used for ignoring the specific values. If you don’t need the specific values or the values are not used, just assign the values to underscore.

Give special meanings to name of variables and functions

The underscore may be most used in ‘naming’. The PEP8 which is Python convention guideline introduces the following 4 naming cases.

_single_leading_underscore
This convention is used for declaring private variables, functions, methods and classes in a module. Anything with this convention are ignored in [code ]from module import *[/code]. 
However, of course, Python does not supports truly private, so we can not force somethings private ones and also can call it directly from other modules. So sometimes we say it “weak internal use indicator”.

single_trailing_underscore_
This convention could be used for avoiding conflict with Python keywords or built-ins. You might not use it often.

__double_leading_underscore
This is about syntax rather than a convention. double underscore will mangle the attribute names of a class to avoid conflicts of attribute names between classes. (so-called “mangling” that means that the compiler or interpreter modify the variables or function names with some rules, not use as it is) 
The mangling rule of Python is adding the “_ClassName” to front of attribute names are declared with double underscore. 
That is, if you write method named “__method” in a class, the name will be mangled in “_ClassName__method” form.

And the best One is this:

To separate the digits of number literal value

This feature was added in Python 3.6. It is used for separating digits of numbers using underscore for readability.

Valiant’s PAC and the VC-dimension, introduced by V. Vapnik and A. Chevronenkis are deep.

Is machine learning really difficult?,"No. I wrote my first ML program waaay back in 1982, before there was Internet, Google, GPU computing, laptops, cellphones, digital cameras, desktop PCs, heck before there was almost anything remotely resembling what you see in the tech world around you today.

How did I even discover the existence of such a field? Back then, to educate oneself, you read books. Of course, you had to either go to a library, or in my case, a quaint event called a book fair. I attended a large book fair in New Delhi, India’s capital, and picked up this 800 page tome, a fairly massive affair. Why, I don’t know. After all, I was at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, studying to become an electrical engineer.

Hofstadter’s first book, and in my opinion, still his best, was an utter revelation to me. It opened up a whole new world of imagination of what deep links there are between art, music and abstract math, realized by the three central characters — Johann Sebastian Bach, Maurice Escher, Kurt Gödel — and computing, including of course AI and ML.

The book featured an intriguing set of visual puzzles from a Russian researcher named Bongard, where the task is to discover a rule that separates the six figures on the left from those on the right. This is an elementary problem in ML called classification. It’s analogous to distinguishing email from spam or deciding if an image contains a face. As humans, we classify sensory stimuli billions of times through our lives, and our very survival depends on it. As you cross the road, is the object approaching you a person or a Fedex truck? Get the answer wrong and your life may indeed be over. Not surprisingly, we solve such problems amazingly well.

I’ll leave you to work this one out, but with absolutely no training in this field, I nonetheless decided to foolishly make this the core of my Masters thesis project. Somehow I plodded through and worked out a solution, however naively it seems in retrospect. That experience made me realize that AI and ML was my life’s goal, and I decided to come to the United States in 1983, where I was incredibly fortunate to work with this brilliant Stanford educated researcher, Thomas Mitchell, now the Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

From Tom, I learned the most important lesson of all, which no book can teach you. Research is *fun*. He simply embodied the spirit of a researcher who bubbled with enthusiasm for the field of ML. He worked harder than anyone I had met, yet seemed to be having a ball. That lesson made a huge imprint on me and stayed with me ever since.

After getting my PhD, I joined IBM Watson Research in New York in late 1989, where they couldn’t figure out what to do with an ML researcher. So they threw me into a newly formed robotics group, even though I had absolutely no background in this field. I had never ever programmed a robot. Amazingly enough, I seemed to thrive in this somewhat challenging situation, and ended up writing some of my most highly cited papers, exploring how robots can acquire new behaviors using the newly emerging field of reinforcement learning. I also published in 1993 perhaps the first book on robot learning, which featured research from all over the world in this new area of AI. Despite having no background in robotics, I still managed to make a name for myself.

Many years later, I was elected a Fellow of AAAI, the leading international professional society for AI researchers. Each year, a small handful of researchers are selected and the competition is fierce. This year’s AAAI Fellows include some of the founders of the deep learning revolution: Yoshua Bengio, and Yann Le Cun.

The list of AAAI Fellows include some of the most amazing researchers in AI and ML, and I’m humbled to be listed in such distinguished company. None of this would have happened if back in 1982, I thought doing ML with no formal training in this field, with primitive computing, or doing robot learning at IBM in 1990 with no training in robotics, was “difficult”.

For those aspiring young researchers reading this on Quora, the best advice I can give you is that nothing is “difficult” if you set yourself the challenge of working on it. Above all, remember: research is fun! It’s an exploration into the unknown.

For many years, from 2001–2018, I was privileged to co-direct the Autonomous Learning Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, with one of reinforcement learning’s true pioneers, Andrew Barto. Andy and his former PhD student, Rich Sutton, helped establish the modern field of RL, the area that gave rise to Deep Mind and Alpha Go Zero. Andy and Rich embodied the true spirit of researchers having fun and working with them was the best professional experience of my career.

PhD students at the lab hung up a sign on the main door that was a quote from one of the most distinguished scientists of all time, Albert Einstein.

That sums it all. Research doesn’t need expertise. Einstein in fact hated textbook knowledge. Above all, he prized imagination, the ability to dream. If you want to make your children smart, he told parents, teach them fairy stories.

As we battle the latest pandemic, the Wuhan coronavirus, the biggest weapon at our disposal is our ability to sequence its genome. The biggest breakthrough in biology of the 20th century came from Watson and Crick, two brash biologists who upturned the world of biology by having fun! Watson went on to write a highly popular account of their discovery called the Double Helix. In it he tells the story of how they scandalized established researchers, like Oswald Avery of Columbia University, when he realized they didn’t know elementary biochemistry. Yet, by playing with 3D models and in effect stealing from Rosalind Franklin’s carefully gathered data sets, they cracked the secret of life. They were simply having fun!

So, again, my answer is, no, ML is not difficult. It is fun!",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=194849445,2020-01-29T01:15:51.169192+00:00,2020-11-28T16:39:32.936709+00:00,1174,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
What are the hardest concepts to grasp in machine learning?,"Since everyone’s experience with ML is different I’ll list the concepts that I’ve had trouble with and that I’ve seen other data scientists struggle with (especially beginners):

 * Solving problems the ML way. Since I come from a developer background one of the hardest things to wrap my head around was the whole idea of feeding data into an algorithm and having it magically predict things. This is very counter-intuitive especially when you work with neural networks. In traditional software development, you write your code you can debug it and at every step of the way you know what it's doing. With ML its a whole different story. First, you have to think in terms of inputs and outputs and not in terms of devising a set of instructions on how to solve a problem. Then you collect some data and you pick a learning algorithm over which you have very little control. Yes, you can tune it through its hyperparameters but you can’t really say if it's doing the right thing until its done learning.
 * How neural networks “store” information. This is a question I get asked very often by beginners and sometimes more experienced data scientists. If you try to think about how a classical algorithm works you know that all algorithms rely on instructions and stored information. Yes, neural networks also use the same storage devices as other algorithms but the instructions they use to process that information are stored in a completely different way. You basically have information being stored in the weights of connections between neurons. That’s really hard to imagine when you think about it because you can never be sure what each neuron actually represents. So trying to understand how a neural network is deciding on what the output should be is pretty challenging.
 * Why data is more important than the algorithm you use to solve your problem. Again if you’re coming from a developer background this can seem super weird. With normal software development, the algorithm you use is the single most important part of your application. It's the application itself! Data is just the stuff you feed into your amazing algorithm to produce an output. The better your algorithm the better your results. With ML, however, the learning algorithm doesn’t matter as much as the quality of the data. Which to a software developer makes no sense. Since we’re used to working with noisy often broken data we don’t really stop and think that data can actually be useful. In ML good data can give you decent results even if you’re using an average algorithm. This shift in mindsets is often quite difficult for engineers who aren’t used to having data do their work for them. It took me a fairly long time to wrap my head around this idea and to stop looking for better algorithm and to start looking into my data and trying to improve its quality instead of my algorithm’s.
The way I got around to grasping these concepts was through lots of practice. So to all beginners, I’d say don’t let ML scare you and keep on experimenting til you’ve mastered it.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=139228965,2019-05-07T10:03:03.983765+00:00,,7,Tony Petrov,https://www.quora.com/profile/Tony-Petrov
What are the hardest concepts to grasp in machine learning?,"I'll suggest metric geometry. There are a lot of ways to measure the distance between points or groups of points within a given space. You can measure as the bird flies (Euclidean) or as a car would have to drive (Manhattan). You can weight either one of these to deal with outliers (Canberra, Mahalanobis...). Or you can have a curved space that needs to deal with geodesics and mapping between the curved space and a given point's tangent space. Entropy might be a reasonable measure, particularly if you're working with distributions. Speaking of distributions, you might consider Frechet distance or Wasserstein distance or maybe even Hausdorff or Gromov-Hausdorff distance. And then there are the more exotic spaces equipped with a different kind of metric altogether...

Each of these has its own set of positives and negatives (no pun intended), and it's a lot to keep straight. For those that are interested, I have ~30 pages dealing with metrics and measurement in my forthcoming machine learning book.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=139745673,2019-05-09T12:21:27.163661+00:00,,44,Anonymous,

What are the most complex math concepts in machine learning?,"I’m pretty torn among a few areas. Tensor research is quite sophisticated, and there’s a lot of open problems in the field, particularly in decomposition for psychometric applications and blending tensor analyses into tools like deep learning. Topological data analysis, particularly some of the statistical applications, is pretty complex if you’re doing research—or even just trying to read the papers. I’d have to say the most complex is probably some of the emerging applications in numerical algebraic geometry and differential-geometry-based tools. There are some doozies out there. Dr. Yau, a Fields Medalist who has a legitimate chance of becoming a Nobel winner, and a few other teams have done some brain imaging applications blending PDEs and actively-developed areas of differential geometry (Ricci curvature, conformal mapping, Teichmuller spaces…).

Which is easier to learn - AI or machine learning?,"Rather than giving a verdict on which one is easier I would prefer giving the set of skills that you need to acquire in order to build a career in either of these. Not only there is a plethora of resources available, they also age very fast. Couple this with a lot of technical jargon and you can see why people get lost while pursuing AI or machine learning.

Machine Learning

You cannot master machine learning without undergoing the grind yourself. You have to spend hours understanding the nuances of feature engineering, its importance and the impact it can have on your models.

There are multiple languages which provide machine learning capabilities. Currently “R” and “Python” are the most commonly used languages and there is enough support / community available for both. Before entering into world of ML, choose one of these two language (R or Python) which can help to focus on machine learning. Keep your focus on understanding the basics of the language, libraries and data structure.

It is good to have understanding about the descriptive and inferential statistics before you start serious machine learning development. Great samples are Naive Bayes, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Hidden Markov Models. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models.

Spend quality time on feature engineering and data cleaning, the more time you spend here the better machine learning professional you will turn out to be

You should now take up some well-structured course to gain in depth understanding of Machine Learning. Here are some key skills you need to pick up:

Applied Math and Algorithms: You will need to understand subjects such as gradient decent, convex optimization, lagrange, quadratic programming, partial differential equations and alike. Also, get used to looking at summations.

Distributed Computing: machine learning jobs entail working with large data sets which needs to be distributed across an entire cluster. Projects such as Apache Hadoop and cloud services like Amazon’s EC2 makes it easier and cost-effective.

Expertise in Unix Tools: You should also master all of the great unix tools that were designed for this: cat, grep, find, awk, sed, sort, cut, tr, and more.

Advanced Signal Processing techniques: Feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms such as: wavelets, shearlets, curvelets, contourlets, bandlets.

After you are done with most of machine learning techniques, it’s time to explore advanced machine learning techniques to understand different structure of data like Deep Learning and Machine Learning with Big Data.

Artificial Intelligence

AI is a broad topic ranging from simple calculators to self-steering technology to something that might radically change the future. Automation, robotics and the use of sophisticated computer software and programs characterize a career in artificial intelligence (AI). Candidates interested in pursuing jobs in this field require specific education based on foundations of math, technology, logic, and engineering perspectives. Written and verbal communication skills are also important to convey how AI tools and services are effectively employed within industry settings.

Key Requirements For Artificial Intelligence professional is to have knowledge of the following:

 * Various level of math, including probability, statistics, algebra, calculus, logic and algorithms.
 * Bayesian networking or graphical modeling, including neural nets.
 * Physics, engineering and robotics.
 * Computer science, programming languages and coding.
 * Cognitive science theory.
Candidates can find degree programs that offer specific majors in AI or pursue an AI specialization from within majors such as computer science, health informatics, graphic design, information technology or engineering.

There are number of structured courses available in both ML and AI, certifications in Data Science or Big Data related fields also covers variety of subjects and skill areas required for AI and ML. Some of the places that offer these Certifications are Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science?languages=en ], Data Science Council of America,  [ http://bit.ly/2tZNQNG ]General Assembly  [ http://bit.ly/2tZNQNG ]these could be of great help in learning and building a career in AI and ML. Will also make your study path easier and organised.

Precisely Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart” and, Machine Learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves. So Al would require almost all of ML learning in addition to some extra topics that you will have to cover exclusively for AI.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=55166084,2017-08-30T11:31:57.803092+00:00,,40,Manvi Singhania,https://www.quora.com/profile/Manvi-Singhania
What should everyone know about machine learning?,"Here are a few things I know after spending a lifetime (over 30 years) of research and teaching in ML.

1. It is most decidedly NOT a branch of statistics, although I can understand the motivation of those who wish it were so. Certainly, that would simplify the field and make it more coherent, but it would also eliminate many aspects of the field that make it unique. If anything, I would argue that statistics is a subfield of ML, so the inclusion goes the other way.
2. Machine learning, is simply put, the study of learning machines (reverse the words). It’s the (engineering) attempt to build artifacts that “learn”. Part of the problem here is that we haven’t defined what “learning” is. So, a good chunk of the past 30+ years have been on trying to define what “learning” is. We’re not past figuring that out yet!
3. The people who do ML are a curious amalgam of computer scientists, neuroscientists, statisticians, biologists, philosophers, physicists, engineers, and thinkers of various sorts. Just attend a NIPS meeting, and you’ll see why. If anything, this defines the field. As Michael Jordan (U.C. Berkeley) put it once, ML is simply defined as the set of activities of this curious mixture of people who come to meetings like NIPS. That is what makes it special.

"Is learning machine learning rigorously but without decent programming sufficient, at least to some extent?","My current main job is as an AI researcher for Samsung. I can only offer my experience on the matter.

My first questions would be: Sufficient for what and what is rigorous?

I'm unusual from my friends and colleagues: I approach subjects such as ASR, NLU, NLG, rule-based systems, and machine learning from a very theoretical and mathematical methodology.

I do very little programming. Sometimes I need to do a bit of scripting to structure data (so called data science, which in my opinion is more engineering than science). I also need to look at others’ code. This can range from JavaScript to Python or even Perl.

However I spent most of my time reading very mathematical papers (which I still deem to be too practical and applied in that they seem to be doing more engineering than actually writing proofs), I try to design deeper structures connecting technologies ranging from the speech to text, parsing and disambiguation of conceptual meaning, trying to come up with ideas for better Chatbot design, data science of building knowledge bases, and finally my personal topic I work on myself independent of my jobs; algebras and category theory to create a mathematical theorem of knowledge extraction from machine learning.

I list this last thing for it requires absolutely no programming. It requires a lot of abstract algebra and of course set and category theory as well as a good understanding of measure theory. It is a more theoretical, proof based way of combining many types of mathematics used in applied machine learning and rule based AI.

So if you want to do a job like I do as an “AI researcher”, it is sufficient to have a good background in set theory, measures theory, a little bit of Scrum and general project management skills, the ability to read research papers, and an overall good understanding of structured thinking and proof based mathematics combined with knowing how many types of algorithms work in whatever it is you would like to research. As for my big passion, my mathematics on knowledge extraction, that requires as I have previously stated, a large amount of knowledge of algebras, category theory, and general theoretical computer science.

But if you would like to actually build something yourself, which requires engineering skills, computer science engineering. That means at least knowing how to actually build stuff in R, Python or whatever it is you use. The ability on one side to work with datasets and extract out some kind of models from them, then on the other to be able to build a front end or back-end, work with APIs, etc. are skills that are needed to really build a platform. Just knowing how to program isn't the same as actually designing and building stuff. The same can be said with knowing the mathematics of many branches of AI and actually coding engineering solutions thereof.

I do understand that people confuse these things all the time. I get emails and phone calls every single day to do things I am not really qualified for because of this confusion. Front end design, back-end, data science, are not mathematical research on theoretical computer science for many branches of AI.

So ask yourself; what you want to do and what you need to know to do it. Now work hard, with a burning fire of passion in your heart, and you shall have it, given enough time.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=74321651,2018-02-25T17:03:49.679678+00:00,,5,Bartmoss St. Clair,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bartmoss-St-Clair

What are useful theoretical concepts for machine learning?,"Over-fitting is definitely one of my favorite. The idea is that if you have more parameters than data, you can train a model that perfectly memorize the input-output pattern without actually learning the underlying features. Hence the model will not generalize well to new inputs.

Studying human and animal learning, I have been always wondering if over-fitting also happens with biological learning system. Intuitively yes — if I want to pass an exam without much time of study, I just memorize as much as possible. But such knowledge rarely generalize to new problems given in exam :(

Typically machine learning people tackles over-fitting by having a large amount of training data and/or regularization (forcing a smaller model). In our exam case, this means either you study more instances of a problem, or trying to obtain a succinct model by summarizing instances.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=36771286,2017-02-13T20:04:46.330896+00:00,,5,Ruohan Zhang,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ruohan-Zhang-4

Which is the faster approach for learning machine learning? Is it practicing machine learning before delving into mathematical concepts or vice versa?,"I think your question is an excellent and a common one. There is unfortunately a tendency amongst mathematicians and scientists to be hypocrites - we learn from the basic examples where theories succeed and fail, but teach as if the subject is well polished, structured and chronological.

I think everyone learns differently, but I’ve observed that students learn best when they can *first* get their hands dirty by trying to implement these algorithms in a real world context. Do the models perform well? Have I engineered my features in a way which is consistent with the model assumptions?

Once you can attach a concept to reality - and see what it would be used for, it is much easier for most to conceptualize the theory. I believe you do, in fact, need to understand the mathematics of how these models work in order to use them correctly (despite what many people may say). However I do believe this can come later, once you’ve at least established context for the tools you are using.

Faheem’s reply is a common but also incorrect one in my opinion. Someone who takes his perspective would gladly throw latitude and longitude into a model for predicting car travel time into a linear model. In order to understand why you can’t simply throw lat and long into a linear model and why it’s often ok with a tree based model, you actually have to understand quite a bit of the underlying assumptions of the model.

In addition, knowing what the hyper-parameters mean is very important when performing regularization. If you’re not performing regularization, then you are most likely making very serious errors in your modeling , unless your data set is very large and number of features is very small.

In summary, I think the best way to learn most ML algorithms is to first learn them in a very naive way by implementing them to solve a concrete problem. Then when you need to actually finalize this model with proper feature engineering and hyper-parameter selection, the understanding of these models and how they work will be essential to doing this correctly.

Here is a simple example of what can go wrong if you naively throw many features into a linear model:

Model Selection, Regularization, And Evaluation: updated [ https://doriang102.github.io/2017/02/08/model-selection,-regularization,-and-evaluation-Updated.html ]

The key thing to note is that an understanding of basic linear algebra would have allowed the person developing the model to avoid this mistake.

So in summary : sure, you can throw your data into sklearn and get a response back which may not even be that bad. But if you are serious about building models, there is no way around understanding the specific assumptions and nuances in each individual one.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=102250447,2018-10-03T06:26:22.047372+00:00,,10,Dorian Goldman,https://www.quora.com/profile/Dorian-Goldman-1
I want to learn artificial intelligence and machine learning. Where can I start?,"If you are new to the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, it can be a bit overwhelming. So much information is available across the web and in textbooks, but not everyone has time to read three textbooks on neuroscience, machine learning, and computer programming before they start their first class.

I will start by going over what AI/ML is in general and then I'll give you some resources for both beginners and those who are already well-versed in these subjects.

What is Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning?

The definitions of these two new buzzwords are quite simple.

1. Artificial Intelligence: The capability of a computer or an automated system to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
2. Machine Learning: The ability of a computer program to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms build a statistical model from observed data examples and use it for making predictions or other machine learning tasks.
Machine learning algorithms are based on statistical learning theory and artificial intelligence. They are a set of rules that look over data and try to predict the best possible outcome depending on patterns in the data.

Now that we have a basic understanding of these two terms, let's dive into some resources that you can use to get started with both AI and ML (you will find many resources for machine learning, but not all of them cover everything from neuroscience to computer programming).

AI resources and Machine Learning Resources: Where can I start?

The best way to learn something new is through online courses. There are plenty of ed-tech platforms available that provide the best AI/ML courses.

Course name: AI & Machine Learning Master course

It has a huge course library. The best location to learn all there is to know about artificial intelligence is Edureka.

 * The course duration is 200+ hours, and all the sessions happen in an interactive mode of learning.
 * Students get to work on 6+ projects and 40+ assignments on various topics and business cases.
Furthermore, it's not too late to start earning a six-figure wage by enrolling in Edureka courses if you don't feel that your knowledge of AI is sufficient.

However, they do not have domain specialization features in their AI and ML courses.

This is a great site for online courses. It has many features that make it the best platform. All of this is tailored to help professionals in a variety of industries and freshers as well.

Course name: Advanced Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Program.

Course Duration-

 * 9-11 Months duration
 * All batches will receive 350+ hours of training.
The following are the course features

 * Domain Specialization: Students get to choose domain electives as per their interests, such as marketing, human resources, and so on. Then they teach students how to use analytics to understand difficulties in business and that particular domain. This makes them a scholar at their domain.
 * Projects: This institute offers 12+ real-time project sessions led by industry experts, as well as hands-on experience with exciting real-world projects.
Some of the top projects of this course are

 * 
 * HR domain - Career progression planning of employees with workforce defection & efficiency
 * Marketing domain - Descriptive study of trends and irregularities with prediction analysis for conversion.

 * Placement Preparation: After the course is completed and a certificate is issued, the experts of this institute do not let go of your hand. They will also provide you with guidance and assistance in preparing for interviews. They also offer guaranteed interview calls as they are associated with 250+ startups and MNCs

 * In accordance with your schedule, you can choose between online and offline project sessions using their hybrid learning technique.
 * Utilize their real-time, interactive instruction while relaxing in your own home. Experts from MNCs and MAANG help with offline project sessions at numerous project innovation centers in various Indian cities, including Delhi, Pune, Bangalore etc.
Summing up

I think the above-mentioned courses are the best choice for someone who wants to learn machine learning or AI online. You can find many courses on both topics and this will give you a foundation in many different fields so that when you need to branch off into a particular topic it will be tremendously helpful.

I hope that this answer has helped you!

Thank you for reading!",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=1477743651585821,2023-03-20T11:13:30.665839+00:00,,339,Jiya Jain,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jiya-Jain-182
What should everyone know about machine learning?,"As someone who often finds himself explaining machine learning to non-experts, I offer the following list as a public service announcement.

1. Machine learning means learning from data [ https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse ]; AI is a buzzword. Machine learning lives up to the hype: there are an incredible number of problems that you can solve by providing the right training data to the right learning algorithms. Call it AI if that helps you sell it, but know that AI, at least as used outside of academia, is often a buzzword that can mean whatever people want it to mean.
2. Machine learning is about data and algorithms, but mostly data. There’s a lot of excitement about advances in machine learning algorithms, and particularly about deep learning [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning ]. But data is the key ingredient that makes machine learning possible. You can have machine learning without sophisticated algorithms, but not without good data. [ https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf ]
3. Unless you have a lot of data, you should stick to simple models. Machine learning trains a model from patterns in your data, exploring a space of possible models defined by parameters. If your parameter space is too big, you’ll overfit [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting ] to your training data and train a model that doesn’t generalize [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error ] beyond it. A detailed explanation requires more math [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC_dimension ], but as a rule you should keep your models as simple as possible.
4. Machine learning can only be as good as the data you use to train it. The phrase “garbage in, garbage out [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out ]” predates machine learning, but it aptly characterizes a key limitation of machine learning. Machine learning can only discover patterns that are present in your training data. For supervised machine learning [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning ] tasks like classification [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification ], you’ll need a robust collection of correctly labeled, richly featured training data.
5. Machine learning only works if your training data is representative. Just as a fund prospectus warns that “past performance is no guarantee of future results”, machine learning should warn that it’s only guaranteed to work for data generated by the same distribution that generated its training data. Be vigilant of skews between training data and production data, and retrain your models frequently so they don’t become stale.
6. Most of the hard work for machine learning is data transformation. From reading the hype about new machine learning techniques, you might think that machine learning is mostly about selecting and tuning algorithms. The reality is more prosaic: most of your time and effort goes into data cleansing [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing ] and feature engineering [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering ] — that is, transforming raw features [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_%28machine_learning%29 ] into features that better represent the signal in your data.
7. Deep learning is a revolutionary advance, but it isn’t a magic bullet. Deep learning has earned its hype by delivering advances across a broad range of machine learning application areas. Moreover, deep learning automates some of the work traditionally performed through feature engineering, especially for image and video data. But deep learning isn’t a silver bullet. You can’t just use it out of the box, and you’ll still need to invest significant effort in data cleansing and transformation.
8. Machine learning systems are highly vulnerable to operator error. With apologies to the NRA, “Machine learning algorithms don’t kill people; people kill people.” When machine learning systems fail, it’s rarely because of problems with the machine learning algorithm. More likely, you’ve introduced human error into the training data, creating bias or some other systematic error. Always be skeptical, and approach machine learning with the discipline you apply to software engineering.
9. Machine learning can inadvertently create a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many applications of machine learning, the decisions you make today affect the training data you collect tomorrow. Once your machine learning system embeds biases into its model, it can continue generating new training data that reinforces those biases. And some biases can ruin people’s lives. [ https://medium.com/@dtunkelang/getting-uncomfortable-with-data-7339e27adf6f ] Be responsible: don’t create self-fulfilling prophecies.
10. AI is not going to become self-aware, rise up, and destroy humanity. A surprising number of people (cough [ https://www.recode.net/2017/7/15/15976744/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-regulations-ai ]) seem to be getting their ideas about artificial intelligence from science fiction movies. We should be inspired by science fiction, but not so credulous that we mistake it for reality. There are enough real and present dangers to worry about, from consciously evil human beings to unconsciously biased machine learning models. So you can stop worrying about SkyNet [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28Terminator%29 ] and “superintelligence [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence ]”.
There’s far more to machine learning than I can explain in a top-10 list. But hopefully this serves as a useful introduction for non-experts.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=55775741,2017-09-05T17:31:53.088424+00:00,2017-09-09T15:51:00.888883+00:00,958,Daniel Tunkelang,https://www.quora.com/profile/Daniel-Tunkelang
How much should I go into mathematical concepts in machine learning?,"I will try to keep this as concise as possible.

Edit: Somebody merged the original question to this question, so the premise becomes irrelevant.

To become a full stack AI/ML engineer, it is imperative that you have a complete grasp of the mathematical foundations of ML so that you can build upon concepts easily. The basic mathematical skills required are Linear Algebra, Matrix Algebra, Probability and some basic Calculus.

Linear Algebra

The best source to study Linear Algebra is Prof. Gilbert Strang’s Linear Algebra book/course. Video Lectures | Linear Algebra | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/ ] (MIT OCW). There are 34 lectures and believe me, they are completely worth it as after completing this, linear algebra should not pose any more problems for you. Solve some exercises/exams if you want to achieve mastery (recommended).

Matrix Algebra

Matrix algebra is an essential component of deep learning. I personally recommend this (Matrix Cookbook by Kaare Brandt Petersen & Michael Syskind Pedersen): http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf (PDF). There are 66 pages of pure matrix operations and this is the absolute “go-to” in case you are stuck trying to understand certain matrix manipulations that a researcher might have done.

Probability & Statistics

Understanding probability is a very important aspect of understanding ML. Some of the key probability concepts that you must be aware of include Bayes’ Theorem, distributions, MLE, regression, inference and so on. The best resource for this is Think Stats (Exploratory Data Analysis in Python) by Allen Downey: http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf (PDF). This absolute gem of a book is 264 pages long and covers all the aspects of probability and statistics that you need to understand with relevant Python code.

Optimization

The go-to book for Convex Optimization is Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe: https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf (PDF). This is a 730 page book and you need not read it all in one go. Choose the concept which you need to learn depending on your requirements and interest and read that part. It is complete and extremely well written. This book is free as part of the CVX 101 MOOC on EdX.

This 263 page book on metaheuristics, Essentials of Metaheuristics by Sean Luke (http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf (PDF)) talks about gradient based optimization, policy optimization etc. and it is well written. One can choose to go through this also if interested.

Data science concepts are covered in the above topics. Other topics can be learnt by googling for sources easily as and when you encounter them. But complete understanding of the above should suffice for 95% of all scenarios.


Achieving mastery of the above topics will surely make you a mathematically strong AI/ML engineer. Now that you have built the foundation, start dipping your feet into research papers. They are absolutely essential as these clearly show the standards of AI researchers/engineers. Firstly, find out the famous papers of AI like RNN, LSTM, SVM etc. and go through the technical content.

Can you understand the jargon?

Can you understand the mathematics?

Can you implement the mathematics in code now without the help of overly sufficient libraries?

These are the key questions to be answered. Once you can answer “Yes/Mostly Yes” to these 3 questions, you are good to go.

After trying to read these papers dealing with the most popular concepts, try to read the not-so-famous papers. arXiv is a great site with hundreds of preprints being published everyday by top researchers and reading the papers from here is like drinking straight out of the fire-hose. Try to choose a paper which looks fairly well written and the abstract seems interesting. Then, read that paper and try to answer those 3 questions again. The same can be done with papers of top AI conferences like NIPS, AAAI, AAMAS, IJCAI, ICML etc. You may not be able to fully implement the papers due to data constraints and other issues, but if you are able to understand even 60% of the mathematical reasoning, then I can safely say you have completed your training.

Do not concentrate on learning more and more “packages”. Concentrate on the concept. While implementing, you will automatically see that you require “this” package and then you will automatically learn to use it. Learning the various commands of random packages won’t help. If you start implementing and writing codes to solve problems or simulate results from a paper, you will automatically learn about packages and use them appropriately; they’ll be the least of your concerns. This is the correct way to maintain “balance” between math and coding. You can also participate in competitions (e.g. Kaggle or conference competitions) to improve speed, development and processing skills if you feel the need to do so.

How do I learn mathematics for machine learning?,"Great question! How indeed does one prepare oneself for a (research or otherwise) career in machine learning, in particular in terms of familiarizing oneself with the underlying mathematics? I’m going to resist the temptation of trotting out some standard books, and instead, focus on giving broad advice.

There’s some bad news on this front, and it’s best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible. Having spent 35+ years studying machine learning, let me put this in the most direct way possible: no matter how much time and effort you devote to it, you can never know enough math to read through all the ML literature. Different parts of ML use a variety of esoteric math. There’s just no way one person can know all of this math, so it’s good to be forewarned.

OK, with that out of the way, how does one prepare oneself? Think of the process analogous to conditioning your mind and body to run a marathon. It’s a gradual process, of improving your fitness, your ability to run for longer and longer distances, your breathing technique, your mental focus, and dozens of other dimensions. Working in ML is not like running a 100 meter sprint, where the race is pretty much over in a single breath. It’s much more of an endurance sport, where you have to constantly work at it to remain in shape, and there’s no point at which you can relax and say: OK, I know it all! Because no one does!

An example from my recent work will clarify the issues involved. One of the major challenges in machine learning is that there’s never enough training data to tackle every ML problem that presents itself. Humans are especially adept in solving this challenge. I can get on a flight from San Francisco and within a few short hours find myself in a dizzying diversity of new environments, from the glitzy subways of Tokyo and the bleak winter in Scandinavia to an arid savannah in Africa, or a swampy rainforest in Brazil. There’s no way I can ever hope to collect training samples from every possible environment that I can encounter in life. So, what do we do? We transfer our learned knowledge from places we’ve been — so, having taken the BART subway in San Francisco, and subways in New York and London, I can try to handle the complexity of the subway in Tokyo by drawing upon my previous experience. Of course, it doesn’t quite match — the language is completely different, the tone and texture of the visual experience is completely different (attendants in gloved hands show you the way in Tokyo — no such luxury is available in the US!). Yet, we somehow manage, and plod our way through new experiences. We even cherish the prospect of finding ourselves in some alien new culture, where we don’t speak the language and can’t ask for directions. It opens up our mind to new horizons, all part of the charm of travel.

So, what’s the mathematics involved in implementing a transfer learning algorithm? It varies a lot depending on what type of approach you investigate. Let’s review some approaches from computer vision over the past few years. One class of approaches are so-called subspace methods, where the training data from a collection of images in the “source” domain (which conveniently has labels given to us) is to be compared with a collection of unlabeled images from a “target” domain (e.g., “source” → NY subway, “target” → Tokyo subway).

One can take a collection of images of size NxN and using a variety of different methods find the smallest subspace that the source images lie in (treating each image as a vector in N^2 dimensions). Now, to understand this body of work, you obviously need to know some linear algebra. So, if you don’t understand linear algebra, or you took a class way back when and forgot it all, it’s time to refresh your memory or learn anew. Fortunately, there are excellent textbooks (Strang is usually a good place to start) and also something like MATLAB will let you explore linear algebraic ML methods without having to implement things like eigenvalue or singular value decomposition. As I usually told my students, keep the motto “eigen do it if I try” in mind. Persevere, and keep the focus on why you are learning this math. Because it is important and essential to understand much of modern ML.

OK, great, you’ve managed to learn some linear algebra. Are you done? Ummm, not quite. So, back to our transfer learning example. You construct a source subspace from the source images, and a target subspace from the target images. Umm, how does one do that. OK, you can use a garden variety dimensionality reduction method like principal components analysis (PCA), which just computes the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the source and target images. This is one subroutine call in MATLAB. But, PCA is 100 years old. How about something new and cool, like a ooh la la subspace tracking method like GOUDA, which uses the fancier math of Lie groups. Oops, now you need to learn some group theory, the mathematics of symmetry. As it turns out, matrices of certain types, like all invertible matrices, or all positive definite matrices, are not just linear algebraic objects, they are also of interest in group theory, a particularly important subfield of which is Lie groups (Lie → “Lee”).

OK, great, you have a smattering of knowledge of group theory and Lie groups. Are you done? Hmmm…actually not, because it turns out Lie groups are not just groups, but they are also continuous manifolds. What in the blazes is a “manifold”? If you google this, you are likely to encounter web pages describing engine parts! No, a manifold is something entirely different in machine learning, where it means a non-Euclidean space that has curvature. It turns out the set of all probability distributions (e.g., 1 dimensional Gaussians with a scalar variance dimension and a scalar mean dimension) are not Euclidean, but rather, describe a curved space. So, the set of all positive definite matrices form a Lie group, with a certain curvature. What this implies is that obvious operations like taking the average have to done with considerable care. So, off you go, learning all there is to know about manifolds, Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, exp and log mappings, etc. Oh, what fun!

Getting back to our transfer learning method, if you compute the source covariance matrix C_s and the target covariance matrix C_t, then there is a simple method called CORAL (for correlational alignment) that figures out how to transform C_s into C_t using some invertible mapping A. CORAL is popular as a transfer learning method in computer vision. But, CORAL does not actually use the knowledge that the space of positive definite matrices (or covariance matrices) forms a manifold. In fact, it forms something called a cone in convex analysis. If you subtract one covariance matrix from another, the result is not a covariance matrix. So, they do not form a vector space, but rather something else entirely. Oops, it turns out the study of cones is important in convex analysis, so there you go again, you need to learn about convex sets and functions, projections onto convex sets, etc. The dividing line between tractable and intractable optimization is not linear vs. nonlinear, but rather, convex vs. non-convex.

I hope the pattern is becoming clear. Like one of those legendary Russian dolls, where each time you open one, you find it is not the end, but there’s another one inside it, so it is with learning math in machine learning. Each time you learn a bit of math, you find it opens the door to an entirely new field of math, which you need to know something about as well. For my most recent paper, I had to digest a whole book devoted entirely to the topic of positive definite matrices (it’s like the old joke, where the deeper you go, the more you know about a specialized topic, until you know everything about —- nothing!).

Any given problem in machine learning, like transfer learning, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, as a manifold learning problem, as a multivariate statistical estimation problem, as a nonlinear gradient based deep learning problem, etc. etc. Each of these requires learning a bit about the underlying math involved.

If you feel discouraged, and feel like tearing your hair out at this point, I sympathize with you. But, on the other hand, you can look on the positive side, and realize that in terms of our analogy of running a marathon, you are steadily becoming better at running the long race, building your mathematical muscle as you go along, and gradually things start falling into place. Things start to make sense, and different subfields start connecting with each other. Something strange happens. You start liking it! Of course, there’s a drawback. Someone who doesn't understand any of the math you get good at using asks you to explain your work, and you realize that it’s impossible to do that without writing equations.

Most researchers find their comfort zone and try to stay within it, since otherwise, it takes a great deal of time and effort to master the dozens of mathematical subfields that modern ML uses. But, this strategy eventually fails, and one is always forced to get outside one’s comfort zone and learn some new math, since otherwise, a whole area of the field becomes alien to you.

Fortunately, the human brain is an amazing instrument, and provides decades and decades of trouble-free operation, allowing us to continually learn over 40,50, 60, years or more. How precisely it does that without zeroing out all prior learning is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science!",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn-and-what-is-the-easiest-machine-learning-concept-to-learn?top_ans=72758478,2018-02-10T22:34:01.177380+00:00,2018-02-13T10:03:28.965016+00:00,1302,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
How do I learn machine learning?,"Machine Learning is among the most popular and rapidly evolving technologies. It is a field with a wide range of employment prospects. There are several alternatives available to you if you want to get the necessary abilities and begin a career in the field of Machine Learning. There are several colleges on the market that provide Machine Learning courses from where you can simply launch your career. I would suggest Learnbay Institute and Simplilearn Institute among the plethora of institutes since they give the greatest training program and employment help program.

The following are the five most essential subjects in machine learning that you should be familiar with:

1. Probability
It aids in forecasting the likelihood of occurrences as well as determining if a scenario mayor cannot occur again. The cornerstone of machine learning is said to be a probability.

2. Calculus

The topic of calculus is significant in the realm of mathematics, and it is used in a variety of ML methods. Data sets with numerous characteristics are utilized to develop ML models since multiple multivariable calculus is necessary for creating an ML model. Differentiation and integration are two of the most crucial calculus subjects to master.

3. Linear Algebra

It is concerned with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It is one of the most significant requirements for studying ML since it can be used to modify and operate on datasets.

4. Statistics

It comprises tools that are used to extract results from data. Descriptive statistics are a type of statistics that aid in the transformation of raw data into useful information. Another type of statistics is inferential statistics, which is used to extract essential information from a sample of data using a whole dataset.

5. Programming

If we really want to implement the entire Machine Learning process, we must know at least one computer language, such as R or Python. Both of the aforementioned programming languages include built-in libraries that make it relatively simple to construct Machine Learning algorithms.

If you want to begin studying the aforementioned machine learning principles, there are a few things you need to do:

Recognizing the Prerequisites:

 * Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Statistics, and Python are all prerequisites. You don't need a Ph.D. in these areas to get started, but you do need a basic understanding.
 * Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus are both required for Machine Learning.
 * Statistics is a field of mathematics concerned with data collection, analysis, and presentation. As a result, it is unsurprising that you will need to study it. Furthermore, there is one thing you must not overlook: Python.
Instructor-led instruction:

 * If you want to switch jobs in machine learning and have both long-term and quick professional advancement, you can learn machine learning through instructor-led courses.
Understanding Various ML Concepts:

 * Model, Feature, Target (Label), Training, and Prediction are some of the core ideas in ML. Machine learning may be classified into four types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
 * You must also investigate several theories and conduct experiments on real-world datasets. This will help you build intuition about which kind of models are appropriate in certain circumstances.
 * Along with these processes, it is critical to understand how to analyze the data obtained by using various models. This is easier to do if you're familiar with the various tuning settings and regularisation methods used on different models.
Categorization:

 * It aids in the prediction of discrete variables or a class of data.
 * It involves determining if a person has an illness, whether an email is a spam, whether a transaction is valid or fraudulent, and so forth.
Take part in projects:

 * After you've mastered the foundations of Machine Learning, you may go on to the interesting and entertaining portion. PROJECTS! These will effectively improve your ML skills by combining your most theoretical understanding with the actual application.
 * These initiatives will also assist you in your career search in this sector.
If you succeed in this Machine Learning sector, you will have a few prospective Machine Learning job options to choose from, such as:

 * ML Engineer

How do I learn mathematics for machine learning?,"
%3E Mathematics is the most beautiful and most powerful creation of the human spirit.

— Stefan Banach, Polish mathematician
However, Now mathematics is powering up the artificial spirit also. Mathematics is too important for machine learning.

Regarding the source of learning mathematics, you can either opt for self-learning sites like Udemy, EdX, Coursera or professional training institutes like Learnbay, Upgrad, Great Learning.

But, first of all, let us understand why mathematics is important for machine learning? When it comes to mathematics, it is considered a universal subject that can be traced in almost every domain of machine learning.

 * Machine learning is the process of making algorithms that can be trained to learn data in order to make predictions. It is heavily based on mathematical foundations.
 * Mathematics is essential for solving and implementing a variety of Data Science initiatives, Deep Learning use cases.
 * A majority of the mathematics used is utilized in machine learning software ""Statistics and Probability.""
 * Statistics and probabilities are used to display data and data preprocessing. They also aid in the transformation of features processing, data modelling, imputation, assessment of models, and so on.
So, how will you start?

 * Insofar as statistics are related, you should concentrate on key topics like Mean Median, Mode Standard deviation/variance, matrixes, Probability distributions, p-values, Bayes Theorem, and Central Limit Theorem.
 * Staying updated on the subjects that follow calculus is also important and, consequently, requires multivariable calculus.
 * The majority of models for machine learning are created using a data set with a variety of characteristics or predictors. Therefore, a solid understanding of multivariable calculus is essential in the creation of a machine-learning model.
 * These are the subjects you must be aware of - functions of various variables; derivatives and gradients step function, sigmoid Function, Logic Function, the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function Cost function; plotting of functions as well as the Minimum and Maximum values of functions.
If you want to get self-taught, You can search for websites that offer free online resources.

Some of the books that can prove beneficial to you -

1. Mathematics for Machine Learning, Book by A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong, and Marc Peter Deisenroth
2. The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie
3. Hands-On Mathematics for Deep Learning: Build a Solid Mathematical Foundation for Training Efficient Deep Neural Networks by Jay Dawani
Some of the online resources for self-study on mathematics for machine learning-

1. Khan academy
2. Coding the Matrix
3. Machine Learning Mastery
4. Coursera
5. Udemy
Above is the resource where you can enrich your knowledge in a relaxed mood, but if you have a plan for a machine learning career switch, I recommend you to enrol for a machine learning certification course. Because the enriching theoretical concept is not sufficient to enter into the ML job field. Rather, you need more practice experience- that is why you need proper machine learning training to apply your earned mathematical/statistical skills.

Apart from the institute mentioned at the beginning, I would suggest Learnbay data science and machine learning training institute to earn adequate strength on ML maths. Below are the reasons for such suggestion-

 * Tailored course to fit your learning needs:- you may have 1+ years of experience in the non-tech domain or 4+ years of experience in the tech domain. For both cases, the learning modules of math and the rest of the ML concept/assignments can't be the same. Depending on your current professional phase Learbay offers different data science and ML learning courses as follows:
1. 
1. Foundational Domain specialised course for 1+ years experienced aspirant holding tech or non-tech milieu.
2. Advanced AI and ML course for 4+ years experienced aspirants holding tech milieu.

 * Adequate focus on both the basic and advanced level of the match for solving complex ML problems:- Starting from linear algebra to vector and from fundamentals of probability to the cumulative distribution functions, you get both abstract and empirical training. The math learning sub-module focuses on the core of descriptive and inferential statistics. Apart from that, you will get to complete plenty of assignments on hypothesis testing- a very important practice during machine learning modelling. All the classes are live and cent per cent interactive, so you can ask and get your answer instantly, just like a college classroom.
 * Every application you learn remains domain-oriented:- Learning ML math concept is not the ultimate thing you need to acquire to become an ML expert. Rather you need to learn how the same gets applied in your domain. The application of different hypothesis testing practices will be different for HR and BFSI ML projects. Learnbay offers a total of 7-domain elective ML module options, and you can choose and learn accordingly. Below are those domain-elective modules:
1. 
1. Promotion, salesforce management and people management.
2. Telecommunication and production.
3. Hospitality and travel
4. BFSI
5. Retail, e-com and supply chain management
6. Petroleum and gas energy
7. Pharmaceutical and clinical care

As I told you, Learnbay offers career stage-specific support. Hence, technical experts offer the option of a second elective that includes different engineering domain specialisations such as 'embedded technology', 'cloud computing ', 'internet of things', ‘Data Structures and system designing', and ‘automotive’.

 * Expertise project experience:- We all know that no data science fields accept your candidature without a promising capstone project. To get a job in a product based MNC, you need to complete an extraordinary and domain-beneficial capstone machine learning project. Learnbay offers domain-bound and immensely expert-guided project opportunities to apply the most impressive mathematics skills but with the shortest possible algorithms.
 * Coding skill honing through coding competitions:- Learnbay course offers you assistance for performing in different Kaggle competitions. The expert trainers (who are highly experienced ML experts and industry leads ) help you apply the most comprehensive and most beneficial mathematical and machine learning techniques.
 * Additionally, you get a job assistance package to get placed on product-based MNCs:- Even though you own years of experience, still, to switch a job from non ML to ML domain, you need expert guidance. The trick and tips of racking ML interviews at FAANGs are quite different from that of other IT or executive position interviews. The integrated job assistance offers targeted job roles and targeted company based mock interview and CV preparation training.
 * Lifetime access to all the study materials:- You may need any kind of theoretical brush up at any time of your life. Keeping this requirement in mind, Learbay offers all the premium learning material free to access throughout life. Even after enrolment of the advanced AI and ML course, you get two years of flexi subscription for live classes, using which you can attend any of the live classes irrespective of any batch restrictions.
Finally, I must tell you, whatever source you choose to learn mathematics, focus on hands-on learning and pressure as many projects as you can. Bring your own ideas and pursue projects on those.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-mathematics-for-machine-learning?top_ans=310670545,2021-09-28T09:38:59.517407+00:00,,294,Anonymous,

Having spent 35+ years studying machine learning, let me put this in the most direct way possible: no matter how much time and effort you devote to it, you can never know enough math to read through all the ML literature. Different parts of ML use a variety of esoteric math. There’s just no way one person can know all of this math, so it’s good to be forewarned.

OK, with that out of the way, how does one prepare oneself? Think of the process analogous to conditioning your mind and body to run a marathon. It’s a gradual process, of improving your fitness, your ability to run for longer and longer distances, your breathing technique, your mental focus, and dozens of other dimensions. Working in ML is not like running a 100 meter sprint, where the race is pretty much over in a single breath. It’s much more of an endurance sport, where you have to constantly work at it to remain in shape, and there’s no point at which you can relax and say: OK, I know it all! Because no one does!

An example from my recent work will clarify the issues involved. One of the major challenges in machine learning is that there’s never enough training data to tackle every ML problem that presents itself. Humans are especially adept in solving this challenge. I can get on a flight from San Francisco and within a few short hours find myself in a dizzying diversity of new environments, from the glitzy subways of Tokyo and the bleak winter in Scandinavia to an arid savannah in Africa, or a swampy rainforest in Brazil. There’s no way I can ever hope to collect training samples from every possible environment that I can encounter in life. So, what do we do? We transfer our learned knowledge from places we’ve been — so, having taken the BART subway in San Francisco, and subways in New York and London, I can try to handle the complexity of the subway in Tokyo by drawing upon my previous experience. Of course, it doesn’t quite match — the language is completely different, the tone and texture of the visual experience is completely different (attendants in gloved hands show you the way in Tokyo — no such luxury is available in the US!). Yet, we somehow manage, and plod our way through new experiences. We even cherish the prospect of finding ourselves in some alien new culture, where we don’t speak the language and can’t ask for directions. It opens up our mind to new horizons, all part of the charm of travel.

So, what’s the mathematics involved in implementing a transfer learning algorithm? It varies a lot depending on what type of approach you investigate. Let’s review some approaches from computer vision over the past few years. One class of approaches are so-called subspace methods, where the training data from a collection of images in the “source” domain (which conveniently has labels given to us) is to be compared with a collection of unlabeled images from a “target” domain (e.g., “source” → NY subway, “target” → Tokyo subway).

One can take a collection of images of size NxN and using a variety of different methods find the smallest subspace that the source images lie in (treating each image as a vector in N^2 dimensions). Now, to understand this body of work, you obviously need to know some linear algebra. So, if you don’t understand linear algebra, or you took a class way back when and forgot it all, it’s time to refresh your memory or learn anew. Fortunately, there are excellent textbooks (Strang is usually a good place to start) and also something like MATLAB will let you explore linear algebraic ML methods without having to implement things like eigenvalue or singular value decomposition. As I usually told my students, keep the motto “eigen do it if I try” in mind. Persevere, and keep the focus on why you are learning this math. Because it is important and essential to understand much of modern ML.

OK, great, you’ve managed to learn some linear algebra. Are you done? Ummm, not quite. So, back to our transfer learning example. You construct a source subspace from the source images, and a target subspace from the target images. Umm, how does one do that. OK, you can use a garden variety dimensionality reduction method like principal components analysis (PCA), which just computes the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the source and target images. This is one subroutine call in MATLAB. But, PCA is 100 years old. How about something new and cool, like a ooh la la subspace tracking method like GOUDA, which uses the fancier math of Lie groups. Oops, now you need to learn some group theory, the mathematics of symmetry. As it turns out, matrices of certain types, like all invertible matrices, or all positive definite matrices, are not just linear algebraic objects, they are also of interest in group theory, a particularly important subfield of which is Lie groups (Lie → “Lee”).

OK, great, you have a smattering of knowledge of group theory and Lie groups. Are you done? Hmmm…actually not, because it turns out Lie groups are not just groups, but they are also continuous manifolds. What in the blazes is a “manifold”? If you google this, you are likely to encounter web pages describing engine parts! No, a manifold is something entirely different in machine learning, where it means a non-Euclidean space that has curvature. It turns out the set of all probability distributions (e.g., 1 dimensional Gaussians with a scalar variance dimension and a scalar mean dimension) are not Euclidean, but rather, describe a curved space. So, the set of all positive definite matrices form a Lie group, with a certain curvature. What this implies is that obvious operations like taking the average have to done with considerable care. So, off you go, learning all there is to know about manifolds, Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, exp and log mappings, etc. Oh, what fun!

Getting back to our transfer learning method, if you compute the source covariance matrix C_s and the target covariance matrix C_t, then there is a simple method called CORAL (for correlational alignment) that figures out how to transform C_s into C_t using some invertible mapping A. CORAL is popular as a transfer learning method in computer vision. But, CORAL does not actually use the knowledge that the space of positive definite matrices (or covariance matrices) forms a manifold. In fact, it forms something called a cone in convex analysis. If you subtract one covariance matrix from another, the result is not a covariance matrix. So, they do not form a vector space, but rather something else entirely. Oops, it turns out the study of cones is important in convex analysis, so there you go again, you need to learn about convex sets and functions, projections onto convex sets, etc. The dividing line between tractable and intractable optimization is not linear vs. nonlinear, but rather, convex vs. non-convex.

I hope the pattern is becoming clear. Like one of those legendary Russian dolls, where each time you open one, you find it is not the end, but there’s another one inside it, so it is with learning math in machine learning. Each time you learn a bit of math, you find it opens the door to an entirely new field of math, which you need to know something about as well. For my most recent paper, I had to digest a whole book devoted entirely to the topic of positive definite matrices (it’s like the old joke, where the deeper you go, the more you know about a specialized topic, until you know everything about —- nothing!).

Any given problem in machine learning, like transfer learning, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, as a manifold learning problem, as a multivariate statistical estimation problem, as a nonlinear gradient based deep learning problem, etc. etc. Each of these requires learning a bit about the underlying math involved.

If you feel discouraged, and feel like tearing your hair out at this point, I sympathize with you. But, on the other hand, you can look on the positive side, and realize that in terms of our analogy of running a marathon, you are steadily becoming better at running the long race, building your mathematical muscle as you go along, and gradually things start falling into place. Things start to make sense, and different subfields start connecting with each other. Something strange happens. You start liking it! Of course, there’s a drawback. Someone who doesn't understand any of the math you get good at using asks you to explain your work, and you realize that it’s impossible to do that without writing equations.

Most researchers find their comfort zone and try to stay within it, since otherwise, it takes a great deal of time and effort to master the dozens of mathematical subfields that modern ML uses. But, this strategy eventually fails, and one is always forced to get outside one’s comfort zone and learn some new math, since otherwise, a whole area of the field becomes alien to you.

Fortunately, the human brain is an amazing instrument, and provides decades and decades of trouble-free operation, allowing us to continually learn over 40,50, 60, years or more. How precisely it does that without zeroing out all prior learning is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science!",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-mathematics-for-machine-learning?top_ans=72758478,2018-02-10T22:34:01.177380+00:00,2018-02-13T10:03:28.965016+00:00,1302,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
What math do you need to know to learn machine learning?,"As others mentioned before, it will mostly boil down to Statistics and Linear Algebra. However, I am very surprised how vague answers are.

There are lots of different techniques that you can specialise in so I’ll try mentioning some places where you can start. Hopefully, it will make you realise, that there is a lot to cover and how you can start doing that.

Linear Algebra

Topics:

 * Vectors & Matrices
 * Matrix Multiplication & Transformations
 * Eigenvector analysis
 * Linear Equation Systems
Good place to learn:

 * Precalculus | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/ ]
 * Linear Algebra | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra ]
 * Linear Algebra [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm ]
 * http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf
Calculus

Basically, you need to be able to do derivative and integration inside out.

Topics:

 * Differentiation
 * Chain Rule
 * Partial Derivatives
 * Integrals
Good places to learn:

 * AP Calculus AB | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab ]
 * Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus ]
Statistics

Probably, the most important thing is to have a pretty decent grasp on probability density and mass functions (PDFs and PMFs) for most of the common distributions (like Gaussian, Binomial, or Exponential family).

In the end, if you know statistics really well, you can make any machine learning problem into a statistics problem. I would even claim, that the current machine learning developments (apart from deep learning) are just rediscovery of statistics with the computation power of modern computers.

Also, I will skip things like expected value, variance, and etc. because that’s basics.

Topics:

 * Distributions and their CDFs and PDFs:
 * 
 * Binomial
 * Poisson
 * Exponential family
 * 
 * Gaussian distribution in particular


 * Calculating CDFs from PDFs
 * Bayes Rule
 * Naive Bayes
 * Markov Chains
 * Belief Networks (or Graphical Models in General)
Good places to learn:

 * Statistics and probability [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability ]
 * Probability | Statistics and probability | Math | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library ]
 * Journey into information theory [ https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory ]
 * http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf
Optimisation

And finally optimisation. I would say it’s just a part of Calculus (and it would look like that Khan agrees) but whatever. Here you want to be able to find the minimum or either the maximum of some function.

Topics:

 * Gradient Descend
 * Stochastic (Online) Gradient Descend
 * Expectation Maximization
Good places to learn:

 * Derivative applications [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/derivative-applications-calc ]
 * Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] (note: it seems that Andrew Ng is in love with gradient descend so it is covered there pretty well)
What’s next?

There is a lot of material online for machine learning online but the problem with it is that most of it is very shallow and, honestly, it isn’t worth your time.

However, I would go with the following courses:

Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] - A great introductory course to Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. It will cover some statistics and fair amount of linear algebra. Additionally, it exposes you to some decent optimisation basics.

Probabilistic Graphical Models | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models ] - Pretty tough course by Daphne Koller. You might also want to check out a book, that the course is based on Probabilistic Graphical Models [ http://pgm.stanford.edu/ ] . The course will give you some decent intro to Bayesian Probabilistic Models.

Neural Networks for Machine Learning - University of Toronto | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks ] - Neural Nets by Jeff Hinton. If this course is anything as it was before, take it only if you are really interested in neural nets. It makes you do some proper maths, to realise how do those nets actually work. I wouldn’t take it as a beginner.

However, that course doesn’t cover some newer development in DeepNets so you might want to see CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing [ http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html ] or CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition [ http://cs231n.github.io ] to cover things like RNNs and LSTMs.

A quick peek

What it would take you to solve these?

1. Solve [math]Xw=b [/math] for w where X is data matrix and w is a weight vector and b is a target value (constant).
2. Calculate Kullback-Leibler divergence between [math]p(x)=N(x|\mu,\sigma^2) [/math]and [math]q(x)=N(x|m,s^2)[/math].
3. Prove [math]p(x,y|z) = p(x|z)p(y|x,z) [/math]
Given all of this, you should be good enough to know where to go next.

Good Luck

I am pretty sure I’ve missed some important stuff but I am also sure that this will set you on the right track.

Good luck!",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-mathematics-for-machine-learning?top_ans=43746855,2017-05-06T18:05:54.717458+00:00,2017-05-07T09:16:19.835468+00:00,111,Tadas Šubonis,https://www.quora.com/profile/Tadas-Šubonis

How do I learn machine learning when my math is very rusty?,"It is never too late to start. All you need is little dedication and a lot of practice to make your math skills better.

To get a handle on the mathematics behind Machine Learning, you should be comfortable with Vector algebra, Calculus, Probability, Linear algebra, Optimization and Statistics. There are lot of online refresher courses available. Start with Khan academy to learn the basics and then move to Coursera or Udacity or Edx.

Once you think you are fairly comfortable with the above mentioned topics, you can take up Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, which can be a good starting point to understand the broader perspective of ML. It is not mathematics intensive but gives the overview on applications of ML. Then you can take up Abu-Mostafa's Learning from data which will dive a bit into mathematics.

The key to gain confidence is practice and patience. Even if you get frustrated in the beginning, try to get past that. You will become better at mathematics gradually.

How do I learn mathematics for machine learning?,"To get started with machine learning, you'll need to have a working knowledge of linear algebra. This is the mathematics that we use to understand and solve very basic problems with machines. Additionally, you'll need to be familiar with statistics and probability, as well as differential and integral calculus. If you want to become more involved in deep learning, you will also need to know some machine learning concepts like loss functions, learning rate, activation functions, and dimensionality reduction.

What are the different topics of Math you need to build expertise in for machine learning?

 * The Basics of Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the structure and operations of linear systems. That’s because machine learning will often generate “false positives” – vector errors that are caused by incorrect assumptions about how the data will look when applied to a machine learning problem.

 * Linear Algebra For Machine Learning
Linear algebra is the mathematics that helps you understand how data are related to each other. It's also important to understand how machine learning works, as machine learning algorithms are built on top of linear algebra.

 * Statistics and Probability
Statistics and probability can be used to help you understand how your data behaves. Statistics can be used for things like figuring out how many people are in a room. Probability is also used in a lot of different ways in machine learning.

 * Linear Transformations
Linear transformations are a fundamental tool of machine learning. They allow you to move data around so that it can be processed more easily by the algorithm.

 * Matrix Transformations
Matrix transformations are a special type of transformation that can be used to transform from one vector space to another.

Note:

However, it’s not like gathering generic knowledge, you need to work on practical assignments too. And without guidance, the learning will not meet the ML study criteria. If you are learning casually, then you can take help from Udemy, Khan Academy, or EdX, courses. But if you want to get into a lucrative ML career ASAP, then Learnbay can be your ultimate choice.

What are the mathematical pre-requisites for studying machine learning?,"Instead of asking just WHAT, I think it is also important to know WHY. 

WHAT: Linear Algebra WHY: most of the machine learning that we do, deals with scalars and vectors and matrices -- vectors of features, matrices of weights etc. You do  vector matrix multiplication like say in logistic regression, neural networks... Or you do matrix transpose first and then multiplication (for say in error back propagation in neural networks). Sometimes you need to do clustering of input, maybe using spectral clustering techniques, which requires you to know what eigen values are, eigen vectors are.. Sometimes you need to take inverses of matrices, say in computing inverse of covariance matrix for fitting a Gaussian distribution. So you now know WHY you need Linear Algebra.

WHAT: Optimization Theory WHY:  How do you train the weights of your model so that the training error is minimized ? Answer: optimization. You may need to know how to take derivatives of loss function with respect to some parameter so that you can carry out gradient descent optimization. You may need to know what gradients mean. What are hessians if you are doing second order optimization like LBFGS. You may need to learn what Newton steps are, maybe to solve line searches. You will need to understand functional derivatives to better understand Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. You will need to understand convergence properties of various optimization methods to get an idea of how fast or slow your algorithm will run.

WHAT: Probability and Statistics WHY: When you are doing machine learning, you are primarily after some kind of distribution. What is the probability of an output given my input ? Why do I need this ? When your machine learning model predicts (assigns probabilities) high enough to known observation, you know you have a good model at hand. Its a goodness criteria. Statistics help you to count well, normalize well, obtain distributions, find out the mean of your input feature, its standard deviation. Why do you need these things ? You need means and variances to better normalize your input data before you feed it into you machine learning system. This helps in faster convergence (optimization theory concept).

WHAT: Signal Processing WHY: You usually do not feed raw input to your machine learning systems. You do some kind of pre processing. For instance you would like to extract some features from the input speech signal, or an image. Now, extracting these features needs you to know properties of these underlying signals. Digital signal processing or Image processing will help you gain expertise. You would be in a better situation to know what feature extraction works and what does not. You would want to learn what is a Fourier transform because maybe you would like to apply that to speech signal or maybe apply discrete cosine transform to images before using them as features to your machine learning system.

How do I learn mathematics for machine learning?,"👋 👋

Hey everyone!!

Getting back to your question, mathematics for machine learning is quite difficult as it covers not just the basic but the advanced level as well. You can learn it from different websites, especially from experts with experience in this field. From research, I found that learning from courses can be beneficial but it is highly recommended to learn it in full-time programs.

 * Full-time programs: The first benefit you will receive from it is understanding both practical and theoretical explanations. Also, you can find good opportunities if the institute is partnered with multiple hiring partners.
Research on Indian institutes shows that many are available both offline and online. But, for working professionals, online education is better as they can manage work and study without compromising one.

As there are only a few options available for online education, here is a list of good institutes found after some research:

1. UpGrad – You must have already heard about this institute as they offer many machine learning courses especially master’s degree programs.
2. Learnbay – This institute also has a range of machine learning courses but recently they launched a data science master’s program as well which is gaining a lot of attention.

"I want to make my career in machine learning. How do I start? What should I learn, and where?","I work in Data Science / Machine Learning based software products team. My team comprises of Machine Learning engineers, Data Scientists and Data Engineers.

People have made switch from QA to Data Engineer. Developer to Data Scientist. I have given almost 2 years in understanding Machine learning / Data science.

Here’s my take

as Mike West [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-West-99 ] mentioned there’s no easy way. Below are some Dos and Don’ts

1. If you are starting from scratch work on basics first.
2. 
1. Statistics.(Descriptive and Inferential ) Khan academy has amazing videos
2. Probability. Again Khan academy
3. Matrix operations and manipulation
4. Basic Linear Algebra. It will help you visualize things in 3D plane.

3. A programming language. Python is your best bet. Learn various data manipulation and statistical libraries.
4. Learn SQL . Most of your time as ML/ DS person will be spend in querying the data source.
5. Start with some basic algorithms Linear Regression and understand end to end.
6. Get some publicly available data and play with that. Understand the data. Try to see patterns. Apply visualizations for better understanding.
7. Then eventually learn more complex Algorithms.
8. Look at kaggle at other persons solutions to learn more. But frankly dont take it too seriously as real life problems are way more abstract than Kaggle problems. Use kaggle to build your portfolio.
9. Refer some good books.
10. 
1. Introduction to Statistical Learning  [ http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ ]: Excellent book to start with.
2. Buy Pandas for Everyone: Python Data Analysis, 1e Book Online at Low Prices in India [ https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/9352869168/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ]
3. Buy Machine Learning Book Online at Low Prices in India [ https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1259096955/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ]
4. Deep Learning classics like Deep Learning [ https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ ]

11. Eventually read ML papers and try to implement them.
12. If possible get a full time degree. With so many people doing 1 week to 6 months online course , it will be very difficult for you to separate yourself from the crowd.
Dont’s :

1. Don’t fall for boot camps which promises to make you ML engineer in 6 months or 3 months. if its that easy then why companies pay you higher salaries. There’s no magic bullet.
2. Don’t get overwhelmed by so much information available. Start small and basic. Keep on increasing complexity
3. Don’t rush to implement algorithms to data set. Understand each properly, their use case .
4. Try to avoid costly online courses.
Below are the courses I did:

1. 1 year PGD in Data Science from IIM Kolkata .(not recommended) (cost almost 3.5 lakh in 2018)
2. couple of MOOC from Udemy. (too shallow)
3. Applied Course [ https://www.appliedaicourse.com/ ] : Excellent course structure. (cost 25k in 2019) . I wish I could have done it as first thing. The certification may not value much but knowledge you will get will be immense.
I hope this helps.

How do I learn machine learning when my math is very rusty?,"Mum, how can I get out of the exam?

What?

I’m going to fail.

Tears started filling my eyes. I was sitting at my desk with the lamp on, 11 pm the night before the final exam.

Maths C. That’s what they called it. There was Maths A and B but C was the hardest and I was doing it.

There was something about matrices and imaginary numbers and proofs. I couldn’t do any of it. Only a few matrix multiplications, the easier ones.

I did the exam. Somehow I passed. I shouldn’t have. My teacher let me off the hook. That was 2010.

University came and I majored in biomedicine. I failed my first statistics course, twice. Then I changed out of biomedicine.

I graduated in 2015 with a dual major in food science and nutrition. Now food is one of my religions.

2017 happened and I decided to get into machine learning. I’d seen the headlines, read the articles.

Andrew Ng’s machine learning course kept getting recommended so I started there.

The content was tough. All the equations, all the Greek symbols. I hadn’t touched any of it since high school.

But the code was exciting, and the concepts made sense. Ng’s teaching skills meant they just made sense.

So I followed those. Kept going at it. This time I didn’t have an Xbox to distract me like high school.

My math is still rusty. I’ve done some Khan Academy courses on matrix manipulation, calculus and bookmarked some linear algebra courses to get into. There’s one from Rachel Thomas and another one from Stanford.

Math is a language, it takes time to learn, time to be able to speak it. Programming is the same. Machine learning combines them both and a bit more.

I started with programming first. Built some machine learning models, using Python code, TensorFlow, PyTorch and the others. Saw how the concepts linked with the code. It got me hooked.

You can start learning machine learning without an in-depth knowledge of the math behind it. If your math is rusty, you can learn machine learning with concepts and code first. Many of the tools available to you abstract away the math and let you build.

But when you gain a little momentum, learn a little more, hit a roadblock, you can dive into the math.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-mathematics-for-machine-learning?top_ans=142952661,2019-05-23T12:58:51.669563+00:00,,42,Daniel Bourke,https://www.quora.com/profile/Daniel-Bourke-2

How can I learn mathematics?,"I think by ""practical"", you mean in a clear, concise way you can understand, yes?

Begin with a subject like pre-algebra. That's where we start all college students entering as freshmen who score very low on their mathematics compass scores.

Pre-algebra should get you familiar with the language we use when discussing mathematics. It will also take you through what the variables mean, and then will begin to show you how we use basic logic to solve problems.

EDIT: Another thing my article above says is to begin at the beginning: with pre-algebra. In fact, another one of my most favourite sites that I didn't mention the first time is called Purplemath. THIS link is absolutely WONDERFUL for what you need! https://www.purplemath.com/modul... [ https://www.purplemath.com/modules/ordering.htm ]And if you look down the side on the left at those links, guess what you'll see? Pre-algebra!

But the cool thing about this page is that everything is given to you IN THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU NEED IT! ALL the guesswork is removed for you so you don't have to wonder if you're learning everything in the correct order. The thing they don't tell you when you’re in the classroom learning the mechanics and equations/formulae is how the thing you're learning is going to fit into future things, so this is what I talk about later in this article under the subject of worst-taught subject: learning things in a highly-specific order is crucial for retaining and homing those maths skills. And this page will solve that mystery for you!

See, something folks don't understand is that math isn't about the numbers: the numbers just pay the bills. Math is mostly about LOGIC--the fundamental way we attack life's problems. As mathematicians, we're given X, and then we're shown a ton of different tools to prove X. Did you catch that?? It took me three years of maths classes before I realised there wasn’t just ONE way to solve for X, but they were all right! This meant what we were being taught was a set of TOOLS to solve various problems. But no matter what the tools are called, it's still ALL based on that underlying idea of LOGIC. Mathematics majors enter law school in droves each year, because they know how to argue and prove an argument--big skill needed to be a competent lawyer.

Look up Numb3rs on Hulu, too. (It’s also airing every Friday in the States on a station called H&I TV Network [ http://HandITV.com ] . They run 9 episodes back-to-back all day long, so it’s easy to catch up on the story line. My favourite show, and I'm friends with most of its stars. Cheryl Heuton developed this show to show people that you can do more with math than just teach it. It ran on CBS for 6 years.

PatrickJMT on YouTube got me through Calculus II, so his web-site is one of the absolute best placse to begin—especially for lower- and upper-division mathematics students, because he is the best there is--even better than Khan. Khan still tends to use more math-speak than I like, but I quickly realised that Patrick doesn't. He used to teach Applied Mathematics at Vanderbilt and got sick of the politics, so began doing free tutoring videos. His web-site is: Just Math Tutoring [ http://www.justmathtutoring.com ] Let me know if that doesn't work for you.

The second thing I would tell you is be prepared to PRACTICE UNTIL YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANOTHER NUMBER ANYMORE. Math is not a spectator sport. You have to work problems until you're sick of them in order to master it. I even go to other mathematics professors outside my own class professor and beg them to give me more problems. You only get better at it when you work it. Math isn't one of those mystical gifts bestowed only on the lucky few from the math gods. That's a bunch of crap, and I'm tired of seeing that and people believing it. Math CAN be learned by anyone if they're willing to work hard at it. Maybe you will begin and just get it. That's great! But you still might need to work harder at the higher, more advanced mathematics. (It's sad to me that the government is currently whining for more people to enter the STEM disciplines, but at the same time, they're currently telling teachers they're no longer ALLOWED to assign math homework. Srsly?? THAT'S the idea you're going with to accomplish this lofty goal?)

EDIT: I need to talk a little about studying. If you follow both of these techniques you will NEVER have to study or cram for another exam in your entire life. I found something of incredible value since editing this article the last time, and I need to share it with you now, because it supports almost word-for-word what I say about studying without cramming for exams! Plus, it’s getting me through some tough times. See, I suffer with Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus and now have two pinched nerves in my neck. Not only do they cause intractable pain every day, but they’re making my dominant hand weaker and is causing mobility issues. For instance, now without warning, I throw pencils across the room for no reason, and there’s no indication it’s coming. ALL of this interrupts my ability to concentrate, focus, and remember equations. That’s why the following is SO important for you!

REPETITION MATTERS! (This even works for non-maths classes like chemistry and physics!)

Study Techniques—

 * Day 1. Read through section titles and skim for key concepts. (Normally, at the end of your chapters there will be a section for review that will actually say “key concepts” or “section review”. Read these FIRST, before going to your lecture the next day; read those even before reading your regular chapters. It will get you familiar with the material about to be covered, which will help set it in concrete for you to recall at a later date. Every single time I pick up my book, the first place I go is NOT the chapter to read it, but I go to the end of the chapter and section and read through the review stuff. Plus, you can be assured no one else is going to pre-study a chapter, so it will make you look like an extra-smart GOD to answer questions!)
 * 
 * Read through lecture sections, taking notes on concepts. Work ALL examples, sample problems, and some of the problems. You won’t know how to do them all, but that’s the point. It will make sense in a bit.

 * Lecture Day 1. Attend lecture, take notes. Then after returning home, it is imperative that you REWRITE ALL OF YOUR NOTES! Normally, professors speak so quickly that in order to capture what you want, you’re writing very sloppily. Being able to understand what you wrote and what you meant by that little comment “see iLearn, pp. 20–22” means dealing with it shortly after class. That’s why it’s imperative that you rewrite your notes WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES OF CLASS TIME. Any length of time past twenty minutes and you’ve lost 1/3 of what you just learned.
 * 
 * Review the sections of the lecture and book that gave you the most trouble with understanding, then work additional problems at the end of the chapter. I also suggest reworking your example problems, your sample problems, and the homework problems again, but this time, add a few new problems to it. NOTE: ANY TIME YOU’RE DOING HOMEWORK AND FIND YOURSELF FLIPPING BACK TO THE EXAMPLES OR TEXT, THIS MEANS YOU STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU’RE DOING! This is key to knowing if you’re truly learning the material or not. If this is what you’re doing, and you’re not understanding the problems, stop working the problems, put your pencil down, and go back and re-read your chapter again. Re-read the review sections at the end of the chapter/sections, refamiliarise yourself with the equations, and re-work all examples. THEN go back and start the homework again. If you still can’t do it, repeat this process until you can work problems without needing additional help.

 * Day 3. Repeat day 1. The professors generally tell you what sections will be discussed on what day, so do for tomorrow’s upcoming sections/lecture what you did for the day before.
 * 
 * Review the information at the end of the section, work examples, write down definitions (now’s the perfect time to add them to note/index cards! At the end of this I’ll give my favourite notecard app for Android, too), key concepts, and new problems for that section. Then, this is key: go back to the previous section and work MORE of those problems!

 * Lecture Day 2. Do everything you did for lecture day 1, but with new material. Repeat this cycle.
Get in the habit of reviewing what you’ve learned within 1–2 days of learning it. You’re not only keeping up with new material coming at you, but you’re now in the habit of automatically reviewing previous material. As long as you remain in this habit, YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO STUDY FOR ANOTHER EXAM IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

Structure your learning in a way that always reviews previous material; you won’t have to relearn it in a midnight cram session before an exam!


Math is one of THE worst-taught subjects on the planet. Why, and how do I know this? Well, let's tear it apart and find out.

Think back on how you began learning math in school. What were the first things they had you doing? Probably learning to count, memorising the names of the numbers and the order in which they came, right?

Next, you moved on to basic operations, like +, -, x, /.

Now you're older and introduced to the equation: =, and shown that whatever you do on one side needs to be done on the other.

Great. Then what? They upped the degree of difficulty by now throwing in something called variables--the bane of your future existence.

Next they're using variables to determine quantities of things you've never heard of, all the while adding in OTHER, more complicated ideas and equations, like imaginary numbers, functions, square roots that don't exist, more complicated terms like polynomials and rules of exponents, logarithms and the list goes on with each new idea increasing in difficulty, continuing through your senior year and AP Calculus.

Now, let me ask you one VERY crucial question: Was there EVER a point in time in which even ONE of those teachers actually bothered to tell you when this information would be needed, or why? Did even one of those teachers have a half-way decent answer to your constant question, ""What good is math if I'm not going to teach it?"" Did you enter your first Calculus class and feel like someone had lied to you all those years before, because they never, ever told you that it would be like that, because now, after SO many years, you were expected to APPLY those stupid-ass geometric proofs from 6 years ago? Did you completely freak out when they gave you your first problem that included the word ""Physics"" and a bunch of other words??

My guess is nope; nope; yep; yep and YEP!

Welcome to the worst-taught subject. What no one failed to make clear to you is what I said earlier: that math isn't about numbers, it's about teaching you the LOGIC needed to reason your way through any subject on the planet, even if it isn't math. And they never told you that because sadly, no one ever told them. They were only teaching you what had been taught to them, and frankly, no one knew what they were doing.

When you force yourself to learn the rules of these equations and how to work them, it's logic you're learning. Learning the theory behind it through rote memorisation has its merits--if you can recall the theory during a quiz, and know HOW to apply the theory (hopefully, through all the homework you've done), then trying to remember it is one less beast you have to fight; being able to have all your derivatives and integrals memorised BEFORE an exam means you won't waste your time fumbling to remember that the derivative of sin(x) is equal to the negative integral of sin(x).

But the thing I wanted to impress upon you right now is that you need to be cognisant of ALL of it. Make sure that when you're learning this stuff, you realise that it fits into a much bigger picture called APPLICATION. Every single exercise you learn to do right now will quantitatively prepare you for the day when you stare down at a physics application problem and have to calculate how quickly the water is leaking from a 30-kL tank that was half-full when it started to leak, and the water level is lowering at a certain rate in the tub with a specific diameter.

But it will also qualitatively prepare you for the day when you're facing a situation in which you have no clue how to get yourself out alive. The stronger your logic skills are at that time, the greatest chance you have at surviving. (I was homeless for 2-1/2 years, living out of my car with two cats, and if it hadn't been for my brain, I might have been dead, but I survived and am here, and grateful every single day.)

People are losing the ability to THINK in this country, and frankly, it's because of math anxiety, called Arithmophobia (which makes us hate it even more, and it's a proven fact that you tend to do poorly in subjects that you dislike), and poor teachers who probably had it and were too ashamed to ask someone for help, combined with the fact that they would have rather been outside coaching the women's softball team instead of sitting in your seventh period algebra class, making sure you did well.

I started the ""4 out of 10 Majority-Hater's Club"" at our University, and it's for people who are afraid of, or intensely hate math. In it I show frequent clips of the show Numb3rs that I mentioned earlier, along with very cool mathematical facts/oddities that not many might realise. There is a sheer, simple beauty and symmetry to math. I had no idea that there were tons of careers in math that had nothing to do with teaching or being an engineer. And when THAT world opened up to me, I began to see math's beauty far outside the numbers. (Did you know the seeds on a sunflower and raspberry, along with the bracht on a pinecone and pineapple are arranged in a perfect Fibonacci sequence?) But more than that, the club is a SAFE place students can come and bitch/vent about their fears/dislikes, because if you're a student at one of the top engineering schools in the nation and you hate math, then you're suddenly their dirty little secret and no one wants to acknowledge your existence. At least this way, they don't feel like they're alone.


I keep the repetition review in my disc-bound notebook right in front of my index cards. I also keep it in my study notebooks so it’s always in front of me, reminding me that for material that doesn’t come easily or intuitively to me, REPETITIOUS REVIEW IS THE KEY!

I found an Android app a few years ago called “Flashcard Machine”. It’s got very powerful features, but my favourite is being able to declare the front of a card and the back of a card. You can save them in specific groups, and enter either “study” mode, or my favourite, “quiz” mode! It will shuffle the cards for you so you’re not automatically remembering the answers based on the answer before or after it (something I tend to do easily with Asperger’s), and then will give you multiple choice with 4 cards. Don’t just take your quiz once and decide you’ve learned it. Why? Because repetitious review is the key! Take the quizzes ten or twelve times! Since it’s on your phone you don’t have to write anything, and the more you look at it the more you’ll remember them. I’m sure Apple has comparable apps, but with this one, you can even log into their web-site and sync changes you make in one place or the other, keeping everything up to date. At the end of this article, I’ll share photos of my discbound planner and how I use index cards to help me remember even the earliest things.

I wanted to also share photos of the way I organise my note cards, because organisation of both physical properties and time is another key to success.

It’s called the “Disc-bound planner system” and several places sell them. Martha Stewart, ARC, and the Happy Planner are just a few. I think Leverage even has one—I have some of their translucent teal discs. Pages are cut down the side where a 3-hole punch would be. They’re cut-outs that allow a disc to fit in them. The beauty of this system is that you can move pages around all you want! FOR ME, it has the most freedom of organisation.

This is the actual page I took the above from. Now, me being a girly-girl, I use washi tapes and coloured pens to decorate my pages, but with me being an artist, the different colours and patterns also help me to remember things. For example:

You can see the purple discs down the left side. These are for an 8.5 x 5.5-sized planner, but you can get them nearly ANY size you wish, all the way up to A3. As you can also see, the left sides of the cards have been punched so the discs fit, and the washi tape helps me categorise the different subjects.

They make all sorts of accessories for these planners, including the plastic dividers you see behind the cards.

Any time I wish, I can move these cards around, remove less, add more, it’s completely up to me and I LOVE that kind of freedom! I keep all of these in the same notebook with the purple discs behind the calendar/agenda section of the planner. I designed it that way so you wouldn’t have to carry more than one calendar/notebook to class with you. I wanted all the academic things together in ONE notebook.

I am currently working on a highly specific academic planner to sell in my Etsy shop right now. It will be specific for anyone in STEM, including engineering pages, graph papers that coordinate with the calendar portion, pages with index spaces so you don’t need to carry index cards with you to class, you just pop an idea down in your planner and then re-copy it over when you get home, this kind of thing. If this sounds like something you’d like or be interested in, just shoot me a note here and we’ll talk!

This entire subject could make a full book alone, but I'll stop now, and I hope something I've said will help you. Please let us know how you're progressing when you get a break in homework, and I wish you great studying!",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-mathematics-for-machine-learning?top_ans=12864682,2015-05-29T21:33:31.326819+00:00,2023-01-06T20:11:13.155638+00:00,404,Carla René,https://www.quora.com/profile/Carla-René

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"I think that Joseph gave a very comprehensive answer to that question. Undeniably, at the top of that list are the common packages you would encounter as a developer in the field.

However, what none of these comments really touches on is the length of time it takes to become familiar with each of these topics. They are actually quite deep and bad answers that results in 100% classification accuracy are common due to over-fitting. 

If you just want an entry-level position I don't see the need to know anything past Naive Bayes, LDA, and SVM which you can get from most common numpy + scipy packages. Linear algebra will help, but if you understand principal component analysis and singular value decomposition then these things above are 80% of the theory you will need in practice.

I would study harder on learning how to get good features more than anything else to be honest. Classifiers are a well-understood mathematical science at this point. Knowing how to get good features and build good kernels is where the biggest bang for your employment buck might be in more advanced roles.

Since you are probably going to want to implement these you should know your basic programming languages that most people who recruit use, like those mentioned above.

I seriously doubt knowing any fancy mathematics will matter very much. Knowing about reproducing kernel hilbert spaces is interesting, but often in most startups will just want you to keep implementing until it works right on the deployment end. Doing this means you just have to get something to work with the data you have been given. Perhaps this is slightly un-intellectual, but it is often how early-stage ventures work.

If you want to be a data-science person and treated as a scientist, or as anything more than a highly paid technician, and work at the management level you should consider formal education in machine learning and computer science.

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"I simply want to add some comments here—many of the previous answers are dead-on in regards to what a professional in the field probably knows. J. Misiti and others have pretty much covered what will get you hired—but not sure they really answer how to get started.

Step 0: Understand what ML actually is, how it is used, and what it isn’t. ML is being leveraged by big and small companies—ads that google and facebook show, movie recommendations from Netflix, and any number of financial analysis systems or medical research. Even some of the stuff that may sound mundane can be pretty interesting—working for a high volume stock trade group probably pays extremely well but you probably shouldn’t expect to have a life; doing astronomical research and analysis (if you’re into that) will probably be much more mentally rewarding with much, much smaller pay checks.

Step 1: Learn to program. I’d personally suggest Python if you have very little coding experience. Python has a good set of programming tools that lets you quickly run new code and you can even run simple web guis locally that will likely make learning much more interesting and fun. There are any number of ML Python examples out there that you can play with and you can fudge stuff in the programs BUT ultimately to get hired anywhere you need to write clean maintainable code. Which gets us to . . .

Step 1.5: Learn to actually program: By the time you are able to write a bubble sort without thinking much about it in Python you’ll probably already be able to write it in Java or C++ with minimal google searches and the random “I forgot a closing brace” type stuff. At some point though you will need to know, at least at a high level, how a language goes from the stuff you type to making the machine dance. The simple truth is if you understand the ins-and-outs of one modern language you can re-write it in any other.

The bigger issue moving from playing around to being a developer is development tools. I’ve been on eclipse for a long time so I think everyone uses it. I could be wrong.

Step 2: Learn how various ML procedures and algorithms are used. 99.8% of any ML stuff isn’t about re-writing a naive bayes algorithm it is about applying it (and others). If you have a decent understanding of stats and how to apply it you don’t need an insanely deep understanding of the underlying math. If that is what truly interests you go for it.

INTERLUDE: I’ve been assuming you’re looking at the programming side of ML. On that front, just like any other “programming” job there are a ton of different roles. Being a “coder” seems to be the assumed profession but there is Quality Assurance, Architect, User Interface, User Experience, etc. I don’t actually do any coding at all—I deal with builds and getting code into the production servers in a CI (continuous integration) environment. ON that front there are a slew of tools like Jenkins, chef, blah, blah blah.

If you’re dedicated you can get your foot in the door at a company and get paid. If you’re good you can at least help debugging some open source apps. If you’re really good you can help some of the open source apps even if it isn’t providing code.

Step 3: Take a deep breath. Go back to step 1 and see how you’ve progressed. Everyone I work with is constantly learning. They are not worrying about it though—the stuff changes but essentially only the good stuff bubbles up to the top. If you get the fundamentals everything else falls in place.

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"I’ve interviewed candidates for Big Data & ML positions.

First of all, I care about fluency in at least one programming language with algorithms/data structures and crystal clear fundamentals of computer science. This is all that is “needed”. Other skills are “a plus” (well, at least for positions %3C 8 years of experience).

If the candidate doesn’t clearly get past these, I don’t really find the interest in deep diving into Big Data/ML knowledge.

For really senior positions, I haven’t interviewed people myself, but that is where companies care about specifics in addition to the basics. Specifics could be things like knowledge of Apache Spark for instance. These should be explicitly called out on the job description.

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"Machine learning is undoubtedly one of the most debated topics in all business sectors. Hence, it can be said that learning the basics of machine learning can help you develop competitive skills for the job market. Plus, machine learning algorithms are used for assisting companies to identify and extract insights from data, which would otherwise be of no value.

Most modern businesses are altering processes and performance in many departments with the insights gained from predictions. Some of the popular approaches used in machine learning are discussed below:

 * Reinforcement learning
 * Semi-supervised learning
 * Learning without supervision
 * Learning that is supervised
Here are some of the skills that are required in machine learning:

 * Probability and statistics - It can be said that a good section of machine learning is highly dependent on algorithms that are further based on different theories. In addition, different statistical models are involved with machine learning. Those are Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Naive Bayes among others.
 * Applied mathematics and algorithms - In this field, it is mandatory to have a good understanding of algorithms. Some of these algorithms are convex optimization, gradient descent, partial differential equations, Lagrange and quadratic programming, and so on.
 * Programming languages - Machine learning also requires knowledge of trending programming languages like Python, C++, and R. If any student is aiming to build a job in machine learning then, learning programming languages can help them to reduce many difficulties. However, Scrumpy and Scipy Libraries are two crucial topics in programming languages.
Some of the best options to learn these skills are:

1. Online course from Learnbay or Simplilearn-
Course name:

 * Learnbay- Advance AI and ML course for tech professionals
 * Simplilearn- Professional Certificate Program in AI and Machine Learning
Both these institutes will offer you live and interactive training on the course, hence you will be able to understand the in-depth knowledge in this field. Plus, these courses will offer you multiple real-time projects in ML.

However, compared to Simplilearn, Learnbay has more features such as:

 * IBM certification - This institute will offer you IBM certification after the course completion along with micro-skill certification and project completion certification. This will add brownie points to your CV.
 * Project innovation lab - Learnbay offers innovation labs for capstone projects where you will be placed in a team or be required to work independently for the projects under supervision. Learnbay has innovation labs in Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai Delhi, and Pune.
 * Hybrid mode of learning - They offer both online and offline modes of learning where you will learn theories and concepts online whereas do projects offline in innovation labs.
 * Domain specialization - This feature is only available in Learnbay where students will be offered domain-specific training in BFSI, Sales, Marketing, and HR to name a few. With specific domain knowledge, you will be able to compete with experienced candidates as well.
 * 12+ real-time and capstone projects - They offer multiple projects in your chosen domain. Some of the projects offered are Churn forecasting for the telecom industry using R programming with ML, Condition-based preventative maintenance and fault prediction in-depth, etc.
2. Self-study from websites and online platforms-

This is an option to learn the skills of machine learning at your own pace and time for free. There are many YouTube channels and free websites that will offer you study materials for ML and AI. However, it is not recommended because this might take huge time and your concepts of ML and AI might not be clear due to a lack of guidance.

Finally, it can be said that to achieve a machine learning job, you are required to have knowledge of programming, computer science, and statistics. However, the main challenge is identifying the right platform for learning the tools and techniques. If you are a working professional and aim to develop a career in this field, then it is recommended to go with Learnbay as it is the safest choice.

Thank you",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=1477743691757946,2023-09-01T15:39:25.254845+00:00,,149,Gourav Bansal,https://www.quora.com/profile/Gourav-Bansal-144
What machine learning theory do I need to know in order to be a successful machine learning practitioner?,"The list below probably isn't exhaustive, but contains the first things I thought of. So hopefully, they're the most important/fundamental ones!  (Although I'm sure I missed some.)

Statistical Learning Theory:

Overfitting [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting ] -- A central concept in machine learning is that of overfitting.  Roughly speaking, overfitting happens when you train a model that captures the idiosyncrasies of your training data.  A model that overfits to training data cannot generalize well to new unseen test examples, which is ultimately what we want most machine learning models to do.

Generalization error [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error ] -- One way to quantify overfitting is through generalization error.  Roughly speaking, generalization error measure the gap between the error on the training set versus the test set.  Thus, the larger the generalization error, the more the model is overfitting.

Bias–variance tradeoff [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff ] -- Sometimes, it's OK if the model you train overfits so long as the generalization error is not too large.  For example, if you train a complex model that achieves 0.2 error on the training set and 0.5 error on the test set, that might be desirable to a simple model that achieves 0.5 error on the training set and 0.6 error on the test set.  Even though the simple model overfits less, it was so simple that it still performs worse on the test set compared to a complex model that overfits more.  The bias-variance tradeoff is a way of reasoning about this issue: when does it make sense to use a more complex model even though it overfits more?

Empirical risk minimization [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization ] -- When most people think of machine learning, they're probably thinking of empirical risk minimization.  That is, they want a model that achieves low error on some training set.  However, it is important to keep in mind what the assumptions are of empirical risk minimization.  Most notably, that the training set is sampled independently from the test distribution you really care about.  If this assumption is violated, you can get machine learning models that don't behave in the way you want (cf. Algorithms and Bias: Q. and A. With Cynthia Dwork [ http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/upshot/algorithms-and-bias-q-and-a-with-cynthia-dwork.html?_r=0 ]).

Cross-validation (statistics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics) ] -- Typically, one cannot test on data that one trained on, one must split the existing data into training and test sets. However, this is statistically wasteful and also increases the variability since you aren't testing on every data point at your disposal.  Cross validation is a way of getting around that by rotating what's in the training vs test sets. 

Confidence interval [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval ] -- The most direct quantitative way to compare two models is by looking at their respective test errors (e.g., via cross validation).  However, how do we know if two numbers actually reflect meaningful differences between the two models or are just due to some spurious effects caused by a finite sample size?  Confidence intervals are the most common way to deal with this issue.

Statistical hypothesis testing [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing- ] -- A related concept to confidence intervals is statistical hypothesis testing.  The most common thing to use this for is answer whether two models have statistically distinguishable accuracies.  The way statistical hypothesis testing is typically implemented involves using confidence intervals and setting the size of the confidence intervals at an appropriate width w.r.t. the desired statistical significance level.

Bootstrapping (statistics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics) ] -- Another way of evaluating the variability of the model is via bootstrapping, which effectively samples from the training set with replacement to generate new training sets that are statistically similar to the original training set.


Statistical Modeling:

Metrics | Kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Metrics ] -- It's important to understand what your metric of choice is for whatever modeling problem you're solving.  For some tasks, you only care that your model can make good predictions at the top (e.g., ranking in web search), so a metric like precision@10 is appropriate there.

Regularization (mathematics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)#Regularization_in_statistics_and_machine_learning ] --  Regularization serves two purposes.  First, it is commonly used to control for overfitting so that the learned model is not too complex.  Second, different choices of regularization reflect different assumptions about what ""simple"" means.  For instance, using L1 regularization encourages sparsity in the trained model, and interprets simple as having few non-zero parameters.  On the other hand, using L2 regularization encourages the norm of the learned model to be low, and interprets simple as having a small magnitude.

Machine learning Types and Tasks [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Types_of_problems_and_tasks ] --  People often think of supervised learning when they think machine learning (and in fact most of the topics listed here are described through the lens of supervised learning).  But supervised learning is not the only learning setup.  Others include unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, transductive learning, etc.  It's important to understand what kind of learning problem you're dealing with.  If you would rather deal with the supervised learning problem, that often means throwing away data for which you do not have labels for.  Sometimes that's good, and sometimes that's not so good.

Correlation vs. causation [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation ] -- It's important to keep in mind when inspecting a learned model that many things learned by the model are purely correlation and should not be interpreted causally. 


Optimization:

Stochastic gradient descent [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent ] -- Most machine learning models are trained via some form of stochastic gradient descent.  It's generally useful to understand when different methods work well, so you can train your models more efficiently.

Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient Descent [ https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2013/04/01/acceleratedgradientdescent/ ] -- One important concept in gradient descent is momentum, of which Nesterov's method is arguably the most beautiful instance.  Momentum is typically extremely useful for speeding up training.
 
Convex analysis [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_analysis ] --  It's important to understand when your learning problem is convex versus non-convex.  Convex learning problems always converge to the same optimal model, so you don't have to be too careful about how you train (apart for speed considerations).  Non-convex learning problems can get stuck in local optima, and so the model you get back can vary greatly.  As such, it's often important to be careful about how you initialize the non-convex learning problem.


Linear Algebra:

Norm (mathematics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) ] -- Norms are used a lot in machine learning.  For instance, many regularization formulations are written as norms.  Understanding the behavior of different norms will help you in deciding which kind of regularization you want to impose.

Matrix_(mathematics) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) ] -- A lot of times, data and models are expressed using matrices.  Sometimes, you can save a lot of computation time by being clever about how you order the matrix operations.  Other times, you can figure out how to transform your data into the format that some learning toolkit uses by using matrix transforms.  

The Statistical Whitening Transform [ https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/the-statistical-whitening-transform/ ] --  One particularly useful approach for standardizing your data is whitening.  It's good to understand what assumptions are built into whitening, so that you'll have a good sense of when whitening will and won't work.


Outlook:
These days, there are a lot of tools being developed that can automate away a lot of the issues described above, and will thus make machine learning more intuitive & easier to use for more people.  For example, many machine learning packages already do cross validation automatically.  However, those tools are far from perfect, and so having a solid grasp of the theoretical fundamentals will be very beneficial in the long run, because it'll allow you to more intelligently use and compose the existing tools to achieve whatever data modeling task you're trying to solve.",https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-for-machine-learning-jobs?top_ans=15094717,2015-08-27T06:58:07.621122+00:00,2015-09-02T14:55:38.309455+00:00,722,Yisong Yue,https://www.quora.com/profile/Yisong-Yue

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"Machine learning is a complex subject hence, it requires the knowledge of various tools and techniques. In general, it is recommended for ML engineers to know data science as well as software engineering competencies.

Here are some of the qualifications for machine learning positions:

 * Writing algorithms for searching, sorting, and optimizing, whereas being familiar with approximative algorithms as well. Plus, comprehending data structures such as stacks, graphs, trees as well as multidimensional arrays.
 * Data modeling, proficiency in probability, mathematics, statistics, and hypothesis testing as well as the ability to create evaluation strategies on predictive models.
 * Understanding of deep learning, dynamic programming, natural language processing, neural network designs, video processing, etc.
Familiarity with these topics is crucial, however, if you are new to this field, then it is recommended to opt for professional training. If you go for online learning, then Coursera and UpGrad are the right platforms for you.

 * Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification by Coursera - This course has good ratings and it is offered by industry professionals where you will be able to learn the basics of ML from scratch.
However, they do not offer career assistance.

 * Executive Post Graduate Programme in Machine Learning & AI by Upgrad - They have good course modules that can help you with your overall career development.
Plus the course duration is much less, yet they do not offer domain specializations.

As an alternative, you can look for the Advance AI and ML Program for Tech Professionals. This is because, it offers, dual-project training comprising 15+ real-time and capstone projects, which are done in experience innovation labs. The experience centers are instituted in Banglore, Pune, Hyderabad, and Delhi. As it is designed for working professionals, hence they have the hybrid mode of learning, where theories will be taught online and real-time projects will be taught offline in experience innovation labs. Lastly, IBM certification (with Course Completion, Project Completion, and Microsoft course Completion) and guaranteed job assistance with offline centers as well in cities like Banglore, Pune, Hyderabad, and Delhi.

Important: They give industry-specific training. Data science is a talent that can be learned in one industry. All of the projects are built on top of that domain. Sales, BFSI, oil and gas, marketing, and other businesses are among those that are accessible. As a result, you'll be able to pick where to direct your DS career.

What are the most important skills that are needed to get started in machine learning?,"Working on machine learning in the industry is really about merging stats knowledge and practical engineering skills within the particular problem domain. For example, working on recommendations for an e-commerce product would require you to understand the user problems around finding relevant products or services on the website and apply statistical modeling to that problem.

So the skills required to get started in machine learning depends on where you are coming from. If you are a software engineer, the skills to build would be an understanding of statistics fundamentals, knowledge of commonly used machine learning algorithms, and most importantly, developing proficiency in working with data - querying data from different data sources, manipulating the data and reasoning about the data.

If you are coming from a statistics or quantitative background, it would be great to focus on programming skills. Being proficient in one of the common DS languages (Python or R) is critical to executing on any data analysis and machine learning modeling tasks. Understanding and adopting good software engineering practices would be extremely valuable, e.g., learning the data systems that handle the data flow at your company, testing best practices, automating commonly used workflows as libraries.

Besides these, to me, the most crucial skill for applying machine learning in the industry is knowing how to take a business problem, understand where machine learning can be useful and cast the business problem as a machine learning problem.

Why is machine learning regarded as the best career?,"The label of being the “best career” that is attributed to Machine Learning is definitely undeserved. It all stems from one word; hype.

“WHAT!” scream the millions of deep learning enthusiasts and ML engineers waiting in the wings.

Let me explain before pitchforks are raised.


There is no doubt Machine Learning is an interesting field to be in. It’s not only intellectually stimulating, its results appear near magic to the general public. Machines beating the world’s best at Go, self driving cars, Snapchats face filters. It’s sexy to be a Machine Learning engineer, to be involved in the very real wave of new technologies.


But there comes a point where the public greatly over values a profession. News articles such as the New York Times’ listing salaries of 300 - 500k for AI professionals [1] lead young graduates to believe Machine Learning is the best way to make big money. The problem begins when people start to pursue a career in Machine Learning because it’s the supposed “best career”. Combine this with the fact the field is so vaguely defined, encompassing everything from Data Engineers to statisticians to quantitative analysts with Python and you have a misinformed public and a ballooned valuation.


Since the field is so young, there are massive shortages in graduates educated with the relevant skills. As a result, salaries have of course rocketed. However, just a few years behind, the Universities of the world are starting more and more “Data Science” and “Machine Learning” degree programmes. Surely, this is the answer to the job shortage problem? Not quite. Because the field’s value is so distorted universities across the globe are starting sub par programmes which receive buckets of applications from (genuinely interested) students. These programmes make nice money for the university but only make the problem worse. Thousands of graduates now qualified as “Machine Learning experts” are under equipped for the task necessary, further clouding the definition of Machine Learning field. You can bet that in the years to come, when ML has stabilised, so too will the salaries and only those who are truly interested in the field will find their jobs fulfilling.


The real message I want to communicate in this answer is not that Machine Learning is overly hyped. My main message is that there is no such thing as “the best career”. There is only “the best career for you”. The most important thing to remember (just like for any job, however publicly valuable) is to honestly assess whether you have a genuine interest in the subject. Do you love playing with data and ML algorithms? Do you find the underlying math beautiful? Machine Learning is a fascinating field and, if it's right for you, it's rewarding, fulfilling and you can make some decent money doing it. But it's important to isolate the publics opinions from your own.

What are the benefits of pursuing a career in machine learning?,"Are you serious?

Here are a few reasons I love my job.

1. Make more than most doctors.
2. Work remotely 100% of the time.
3. Work with really smart people.
4. Not a lot of human interaction. Very few meetings.
5. A total package like C level execs. (Bonus, sick leave, paid time off)
6. For the most part, I make my own hours. I’m not a morning person so I block off my calendar so other’s can’t set up meetings at 8am. I’m still sleeping then and don’t want to be interrupted.
7. Tons of jobs. If I don’t like my job for any reason, I move on.
8. A career for life. At 50, I’ll never not have job in this space. Ever.
9. Highly respected. This career is one of the most technical and respected in all of IT.
Those are a few reasons that make machine learning a great career.

Now, don’t kid yourself. I’ve been working with data and BI for 20 years. You won’t be in a MLE role in a few months and not likely in a few years but I wouldn’t change a thing.

Is Machine Learning a good choice for a career?,"Hello Geeks, have u confused to choose Machine learning for your career?

Things you should know before you go through Machine learning :

What is actually Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

Why it's important?

Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies.

It's Use cases :

Machine learning has applications in all types of industries, including manufacturing, retail, healthcare and life sciences, travel and hospitality, financial services, and energy, feedstock, and utilities. Use cases include:

 * Manufacturing. Predictive maintenance and condition monitoring
 * Retail. Upselling and cross-channel marketing
 * Healthcare and life sciences. Disease identification and risk satisfaction
 * Travel and hospitality. Dynamic pricing
 * Financial services. Risk analytics and regulation
 * Energy. Energy demand and supply optimization
Machine Learning Salary in India: Based On Company

In India as straight forward, the bigger the brand or company, the higher is the salary an individual can expect. The bigger IT industries like Tata Consultancy Services Limited offers about Rs. 4,42,000 per annum as salary. It is followed by Intel Corporation at Rs 20,00,000.

Why is machine learning regarded as the best career?,"Machine learning by itself cannot be considered a career. It is a part of computer science and denotes a class of methods applied by people in different careers, especially data science. In fact, careers like machine learning engineer and machine learning scientists are what you would call popular career choices. The work is exciting, and people get paid a lot.

Machine learning is a growing field, and there are massive shortages in potential candidates who have the right education with the relevant skills. This has resulted in enormous salaries for the few who have the proper knowledge. But the field of machine learning is vaguely defined, encompassing everything from quantitative analysts to data engineers.

However, pursuing machine learning because it is the ‘best career’ is not the right way to go about it. Many people join online courses [ https://www.upgrad.com/ ] like Coursera and Udemy in the hopes of becoming a part of the next big thing. But you need to have a knack for this career choice if you want to be successful later. This also makes focused courses such as upGrad’s machine learning course (gets you a diploma from IITB, offers project experience, and makes you a part of a community of co-learners) a better option.

Also, avoid joining subpar programs from unknown universities. You might become a qualified expert but fail to exercise the knowledge and expertise necessary to do tasks appropriately. This will hamper your career growth over time. Once machine learning stabilizes, the salaries will too, and only candidates genuinely interested in the field will find the jobs fulfilling, not the ones who are motivated by hype.

At the end of the day, there is nothing called the best career. It all depends on what is right for you. Assess whether you are genuinely passionate about the subject.",https://www.quora.com/Is-Machine-Learning-a-good-choice-for-a-career?top_ans=189107473,2019-12-30T12:13:54.661292+00:00,,0,Kechit Goyal,https://www.quora.com/profile/Kechit-Goyal
"How should I start to learn machine learning from scratch, from the beginner to the advanced level?","Great answers here already:

The foundation of machine learning (ML) is maths and not data science. So start by polishing up your maths skills. ML currently is a very hot area with many more people trying to learn it but most don't understand that the underlying principles in machine learning are that of optimization theory in maths.

Thus to give you a boost revisit the prerequisites.

1. Maths:
2. 
1. Linear algebra: Make sure you are comfortable with matrices, vectors and singular value decomposition (SVD).
2. Calculus: Especially differential calculus, become comfortable with evaluation of derivatives of any function and learn chain rule.
3. Numerical optimization: Like I said above ML is currently more related to numerical optimization than anything else. Most optimization methods are variants of gradient descent such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). So learn about first order and second order optimization methods.
4. Statistics and probability: Bayes theorem, random variables, probability distribution functions such as the Binomial and Gaussian distributions. Sigmoid and softmax functions are motivated by probability.

3. Programming: In any of the following:
4. 
1. 
1. Python: Is an easy to learn scripted language that you can quickly pick up for the purpose of practicing what you are learning. Python has a lot of ML libraries supporting it thus it is ideal not only for beginners but also for experts.
2. Java: is a fairly high-level language that is fairly easy to learn but not as easy as Python. It also has a lot of ML libraries supporting it.
3. C/C++: Don't mess with this one at beginner level but start getting used to writing ML code from scratch as you advance so that you can learn more details about most ML algorithms. It is recommended to build your own mini-ML library at some point in your learning journey using such low-level high-performance languages.


With that said, there are several roadmaps to reaching your destination. I can split them up into three stages.

1. Beginner stage.
2. Intermediary stage.
3. Advanced (expert) stage.
Beginner stage:

The beginning part has been partially covered above, begin with maths. And if you are not good at maths you will need to make sure you are good. Thus make sure to sharpen the axe before starting to chop down the tree. Maths is very important for learning ML as most of the times, systems are expressed in mathematical terms. So before starting, please go through the basics. Don't worry about forgetting something along the way, you can always go back to revisit the stuff you have forgotten, this is not an exam.

This is where you also have to set yourself up for success in ML, so I suggest you skim through the basic concepts of ML and the book [1] by Ian Goodfellow and others is an excellent book to introduce you to ML and the current hot area in ML called deep learning (DL). Go through the book in any order you like but make sure to read the introduction first.

At beginner level is also the time to sharpen up another axe, programming. Practice coding on problems that are not even related to ML so that you can learn the syntax of that language. You can't learn coding by reading but through practice. Python being English-like is very easy to pick up and there are a lot of resources out there teaching Python coding. Just Google and you will find high quality tutorials on Python programming. In fact your best way to learn coding is to just jump directly to coding and just Google and Stackoverflow your way through learning the syntax of the language. Every modern programmer owes their project completions to Google and Stackoverflow, let no one lie to you, we are in an era of powerful “cheating” tools like Google search. Don't just copy and paste though, understand the solutions you find online and code your own versions afterwards. If you can't code a matrix operation in Python just Google and try to understand what others did. Sometimes very basic code can be just copied and pasted.

Also go through the TensorFlow (TF) tutorials as well. They will not only introduce you to TF but also to the concepts of ML such as linear and logistic regression.

Intermediary stage:

At this stage you should have already read several online sources such as articles, books and watched several YouTube videos on ML and you should have coded up some models at high-level using libraries like TF. Now it is time to start moving forward, you need to make sure that that knowledge does not slip away, you need to consolidate that knowledge in your mind.

This is where things start to get interesting because you need to now ask yourself, can I implement backpropagation algorithm from scratch? You will notice that you probably wouldn't, that's okay. You need at this point to start pursuing proofs like deriving mathematical expressions you find while reading ML literature. Try to derive backprop for simple neural networks yourself from your own perspective and understanding and see if you can translate that maths to actual working code. Try to also implement convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) from scratch.

This is where you start to build your mini-ML library. You will be able to learn a great deal of detail about ML this way. Implement stochastic gradient descent and train your own ML models using your own mini-ML library and debug until the models work comparable to those from mature libraries like TF. Open source the mini-ML library afterwards to further show off your skills to potential employers or for the purpose of getting into the Google Brain residency program for example.

You also need to start reading journal after journal at this point. At first it will be hard but with more reading and rereading you will start to understand even complex journals from the likes of DeepMind, OpenAI, Microsoft, Facebook and Google. If you start to understand journals it means you are advancing well towards your goal.

Advanced stage:

Yes coding your own mini-ML library is sort of like reinventing the wheel but it is essential for learning the details of the most important underlying concepts in machine learning but not sufficient to make you an expert. This advanced stage comes after spending a few years in the intermediary stage.

In the advanced stage you need to start paying attention to your own intuitions and ideas. Build or start working on actual novel ML algorithms. You will need to empirically or theoretically validate your ideas by implementing them and doing lots of experiments. It is somewhat hard to design a novel ML algorithm as the ideas come, in form of a eureka moment, after years or months of thinking and lots of research work.

This is why being at an advanced level requires that you have built up a strong mental model of the field of ML from a variety of angles. You don't have to be an expert programmer though, as the coding skills only need to help you implement your models.

At this stage start asking and pursuing deep questions to which there are no answers yet. Focus on areas that are counterintuitive and try to come up with more novel intuitive solutions to those areas. It is like a PhD program.


That is a possible roadmap for someone trying to learn ML. It is also important to practice by explaining complex ML systems to someone else. Quora is a great place for answering ML related questions, that way you will be able to consolidate your knowledge when explaining the ML algorithms to others, it's a win-win situation, you help others while you gain and consolidate knowledge yourself.

The other thing worth noting is that you really need to be passionate about the ML field otherwise it won’t be easy. You also need to have tenacity because some concepts take long to understand fully, you may think that you get a concept up until it's time to implement it yourself. Thus learning ML especially by yourself requires serious discipline and focus. You can only maintain that focus if you are passionate and determined to learn ML.

With that said the journey itself is quite fun, fulfilling and challenging, not hard but challenging just keep going and read anything that interests you concerning ML.

Be passionately curious, you will get there.

Hope this helps.

What are the dark sides of a career in AI/machine learning?,"I’m not sure if I’d call it a “dark side” but there is likely to be a bit of disillusionment for most people when they go for a career in AI. Here are some reasons.

1. It’s really, really hard to build AI-based software products. It’s actually really hard to build any software products especially for people without much experience doing so. And because you are an AI expert (let’s assume), you probably aren’t also an expert in software development. You’ll likely discover to your disappointment that building real software products is a lot harder than building simple prototypes. You may also discover that your plan to surround yourself in great developers who can easily integrate your AI-based ideas is not entirely practical either.
2. You may believe that all this great stuff that you are learning about say recurrent neural networks or convolutional architectures are going to be useful for a long time or something that you’ll be building on for years. To your dismay you’ll find that every two years or so the field will have moved away from that and on to something else that you don’t yet understand. This is the nature of AI these days and says something quite meaningful about the lack of a firm foundation and how it’s really an engineering field not a mathematical field. Pick up any book on AI from the 1990s and you’ll notice that almost everything seems foreign and largely abandoned. Realize that, at that time, all these researchers thought they were on to something really big too and imagined those ideas as core components of useful products.
3. The more deeply you understand how AI algorithms work, the more you will realize how the problem it is solving is really not as hard as you thought it was. Another way of saying that is that you’ll realize that things like image classification are nowhere near as hard as lots of other things people do. And while this is making great progress, it is expanding within a constrained area of intelligence. Most of it is concerned with perception and there is no natural path from perceiving the world to building a complex model of the world.
4. If you’re completely new to the business world you may have to learn the hard lesson that just because we can do something doesn’t mean we should do it. It has to be economically feasible and also worth the risk. There is a reasonable possibility that things like self-driving cars (at least level 5) are possible but too expensive to make it practical any time soon. There are many places where today’s AI can replace a human workflow but will take 6 months for a team of 4 to implement which will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That may not pay off for many years and it could fail. And so someone who makes more money than you but doesn’t understand AI will make a business decision to pass on your great idea.
Despite these pessimistic thoughts, I don’t want to discourage anyone from going into this field. If you are young and someone is willing to pay you to work on cool stuff and give you great experience, then why not? Worst case is that you fail to deliver much value but learn some valuable lessons that become useful to you in the future. Eventually, you’ll succeed at something though it may not be what you expected.",https://www.quora.com/Is-Machine-Learning-a-good-choice-for-a-career?top_ans=103555695,2018-10-12T03:32:52.920166+00:00,,1477,David Johnston,https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Johnston-147
What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"In my opinion, these are some of the necessary skills:

UPDATE: I create a repo on github of hundreds of software links that should help get you started: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning

1. Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5])

2. Probability and Statistics: A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.

3. Applied Math + Algorithms: For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16].

4. Distributed Computing: Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21].

5. Expertise in Unix Tools: Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1].

6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects: HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale.

7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques: feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though.

Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.

Good luck.

Is machine learning a made-up profession?,"Hmm…this reminds me of a joke that was on a coaster in my house, as I was growing up many decades ago in India. The coaster read:

“Who says nothing is impossible? I’ve been doing nothing for years!”

Well, I’ve been doing ML for almost 40 years (wrote my first ML program waaay back in 1982 on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) 10 mainframe computer using Common LISP, which back then was the Python of AI, and everyone in AI — a small bunch of diehards then — coded in LISP).

Getting to your question, I’m reminded of an anecdote from Michael Jordan (no, not the basketball player!), a well known ML professor at nearby U.C. Berkeley, who said the best definition of the ML field was that it is the activity of the peculiar constellation of folks who attend the NeurIPS conference. I suppose in that sense, yes, ML is certainly a “made-up profession”. It has neuroscientists, biologists, statisticians, computer scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, physicists, psychologists etc. It’s a complete hodgepodge, and I love that about ML. It has never been a boring field in the past 40 odd years that I’ve been at it. Whenever you get bored, you can always switch to some other topic. My work over the past decades has ranged from very theoretical math-oriented research, collaborations with biologists, psychologists and planetary geochemists, ruminations on philosophy, and everything in between.

I think Geoff Hinton, the “father” of deep learning, made a revealing statement to me in a personal conversation many years ago (I knew him since the mid-1980s, when he taught me neural networks in a class at CMU). He said, and I’m paraphrasing a bit: “I started in physics and failed in that field, did a bit of psychology and dropped out of that field, and finally ended up in a field with no standards!” (deep learning!). It worked great for him! He was the winner of the Turing award, computer science’s equivalent of the Nobel prize! He’s truly deserving of that, of course, having spent his entire career on trying to develop computational neuroscience-inspired models.

There’s no scientific unity in ML at all that I can discern, and I should know, have written papers in the field for going on 35 years (first two papers published in IJCAI 1985, and the most recent paper in ICML 2020!). Some people adhere to the view that ML is statistics in high dimensions. Some people view ML as the engineering of neuroscience (e.g. deep learning). Some people view ML as computational psychology (e.g., reinforcement learning). Others view it as building embodied AI agents (e.g., roboticists interested in ML). There’s absolutely no shared sense of a common problem formulation, or theoretical framework. That’s both a great source of strength — it’s a blending of many points of view — but also a fundamental weakness.

My wife is a statistician, and we’ve been happily married for just as long as I’ve been writing papers in ML! She calls ML the “gosh and golly” profession. What she means is that the vast majority of ML papers are about some “demo”, which essentially says, wow, we trained this deep neural net, and look what it produced (generating face images, NLP chat bot, Atari game player etc.). Take any statistical journal of repute (e.g. JASA, Biometrika, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society etc.). I guarantee you that you will not find an article that says, look, wow, we trained a deep neural net that plays Atari video games! That’s not what a true scientific field like statistics works. Statistics is the one true data science, because the questions it asked and successfully answered are truly as deep as Newton’s laws.

Take the simple question of how to abstract data without losing any information. In statistics, this is formalized as the concept of “sufficient statistics”. A sufficient statistic is a function T(X) of some dataset X that retains all the information in X about a class of models M(\theta), such that P(M(\theta) | X, T(X)) = P(M(\theta) | T(X)).

What this says in English is that the distribution of models that explain the dataset X given the sufficient statistic T(X) is conditionally independent of the dataset X. It tells you how to abstract data so you don’t need to store it anymore. There’s a vast amount of theory on sufficient statistics that you learn in graduate courses on statistics. For example, the famous Rao-Blackwell theorem states that any (unbiased) estimator of a model that is conditioned on a sufficient statistic T(X) has variance that is lower than any other estimator, unless that other estimator is itself a function of a sufficient statistic. So, this is how statistics works. You formalize the problem using ideas like sufficient statistics, and then you work out the ramifications of the concepts using very rigorous theory. Virtually all the major ideas in statistics, including design of experiments, randomized trials, sampling etc. has a rigorous body of theory, which has deep measure-theoretic foundations.

With a small number of exceptions, virtually none of the modern work in ML that has achieved a lot of popular press has any deep theory behind it (e.g., deep learning, deep RL, deep NLP models, GAN models etc.). Like my wife says, it’s all “gosh and golly”.

Years ago, Richard Feynman, the well-known physicist who taught for many years at Caltech, gave a commencement ceremony at that august institution where he tried to explain the reasons physics is a science, but in his view, psychology is not. He called fields like psychology “cargo cult sciences”.

Cargo Cult Science [ https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm ]

Feynman related an experiment done in psychology, one of a very small number in his view, where they tried to understand how rats were able to run a maze and do some task involving finding food. Instead of simply reporting on the results, which is what the vast majority of such experiments usually did, like ML does today, the experimenters tried every single way to fool the rats, and then finally discovered the one condition that made the rats not be able to succeed. When they changed that, the rats failed! To Feynman, this is true science. It’s not a demo, or what the famous AI pioneer John McCarthy, who set up the Stanford AI Lab, called the “Look, ma, no hands!” syndrome. For Feynman, science is the process of trying every which way in which to disprove your theory, to find faults with your approach.

Virtually no paper in NeurIPS today says, look, we tried every which way to make our methods fail, and here’s the ways in which our method fails! No, they all say, look how great our technique is, it works so well on all these (carefully assembled and hand-tuned) datasets with these parameters.

But, I have great hopes that even with all its faults, the “made-up profession” of ML will finally find its savior, someone who will finally put our field on more solid scientific grounds. To see why, all we need to do is understand how the field of statistics became a true science. Ronald Fisher, the “father” of modern statistics, was hired to work at a provincial agricultural station.

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher | British geneticist and statistician [ https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher ]

At the agricultural station, Fisher was shown a huge room where they had the early 20th century version of a Kaggle dataset, a massive collection of leather bound volumes of agricultural data that the station had patiently collected on soil samples, fertilizer, crop yields and so on, but had no idea how to extract insights from this massive 90 year dataset. Fisher, to his great credit, not only showed how to get insights from this data, he invented the major techniques, from likelihood analysis to randomized trials, that are the bedrock of almost every modern empirical science today, a hundred years later!

Fisher faced great challenges in doing his work, not the least of which was that he had no vast AWS or Azure or Google cloud service, all he had was a hand calculator that he affectionately called “The Millionaire”, because that was the largest number it could store! Doing any calculation with the Millionaire involved a lot of cranking of its ponderous mechanisms. Fisher was also incredibly near sighted, and suffered from very poor vision since childhood (a disability that he later prized, as he said he was forced to conceptualize and work out problems in his mind from a very young age).

Fisher wrote a series of now legendary papers that changed the field of statistics, and ushered in modern empirical science, for Fisher’s techniques are used everywhere, from large-scale astronomy, such as the investigation of ripples in the big bang afterglow of residual energy, which earned Berkeley physicist Smoot, the Nobel prize, to the latest vaccines that have been designed for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fisher faced the additional hurdle that the most prestigious journal in the field then was Biometrika, but its editor-in-chief, the rival statistician Pearson, hated Fisher, and personally saw to it that few if any of Fisher’s great papers were published in Biometrika. Fisher was forced to publish his work in then more obscure journals. None of this mattered. Ultimately, Fisher’s insights became the stuff of legend, and the world is a far better place a hundred years later because of Fisher and his laborious hand-calculations with the Millionaire. Each of Fisher’s many early papers had dozens of numerical tables, each one of which involved hundreds of hours of manual hand cranking with the Millionaire. Despite all these handicaps, Fisher succeeded, changing our world for the better.

So, in a sense, the science of statistics started with a Kaggle like dataset, and it took a genius like Fisher to show how to turn datasets into a true science. There’s hope for ML yet! We may see a true “ML Fisher” emerge one day, and perhaps he or she would develop their ideas from looking at Kaggle datasets! I can’t think of a better New Year’s wish, as we close out this truly horrible 2020, and look forward to a brighter 2021.

Happy new year, everyone!

How do I begin a career in Machine Learning in India? What are prospects of ML in India? Which OSS are better to work on to gain a good experience in ML?,"Hi there,

First of all welcome to the world of data science. I would share my experience when I was at your stage. First will talk about the mistakes and then, how to fix them.

a. If you are at a stage where your just completed few tutorials in R programming, or data science courses in in Udemy or Coursera, stop before you feel like let's participate in Kaggle or other such competitions. Mistake 1. Kaggle competition in most cases doesn't teach you data science. Yes it does tell ""it's home for data science, but it's not a good host"", just kidding.

b. Do not tell yourself that if you know how to apply logistic regression, or PCA or K-means clustering et.al [ http://et.al ]. machine learning (ML) algorithms, you will become Data Scientist. No. Stop. Mistake 2.

C. Not trying to ask questions(high level, theoretical and oriented towards business problem and how doing data science would bring answers to those questions. If you are not starting from this way, guess what, you are doing mistake 3. and we can go on with this list.

Now, let's fix them.

a. Yes, you definitely need a tool to experiment, you can pick R which is fine. Others pick Python or Clojure or Weka etc, and some still use Java and Javascript. It depends. So, make sure you are comfortable with R functions such as lapply, tapply, mapply, sapply, as you are going to need them daily. You also practice how to read data from thousand of files sequentially, or from SQL database or from CSVs and try some NoSQL databases. This is totally ""not data science"". This is just an exercise to use R (any tool you pick) tool for data ingestion, processing and make them ready for your analysis. I initially started with Python, and after two years too R and just in a month I fell in love with R programming. I now prefer to use R.

b. Start reading a book which teaches you Statistics using R (again pick any tool you like). Why, because even before you get to apply those fancy ML algos, you will need to understand what your data represents, how are they distributed, how do they relate to each other, do they have missing values, how do you find or evaluate whether those variables are of any use to you, should you remove them or if you remove them are you going to lose any information, etc. You will get even more questions. So statistics. Very important. Still ""no data science.""

C. Once you have basic understanding of R(or any tool) and Statistics, pick the most simple machine learning algorithm i.e. “Linear Regression”. Read it first from statistical point of view, and then how to apply in R and why and when would you use Linear Regression. This will give your first glimpse of how to apply a ML algo to a data set. Then add one more algorithm, may be logistic regression, and so on. Do not rush, as you would need to make sure you very well know what are the strong and weak points of your algorithm. This is still ""not data science""

D. Once you have reached this stage. Pick a case study. Now this could be scary, but its ok. Here you immediately notice mix of statistics, ML algos, programming and function been built to several things. Just stick to it, and cover one topic or section at a time.

You will find tons of case studies online. I would suggest pick a case study on Fraud detection or recommendation systems. This is an area, which every industry has a problem with in this digital world.

Now comes, data science. Say you work for an eCommerce company and your colleague or managers asks you, can you detect fraudulent transactions from the entire transaction history and would you be able to predict it, given that historical transactions are already reviewed by ""domain experts"" and termed them either fraud transaction or non fraud. Well in real world, not all data would be clearly termed. Now, given such a scenario, you would need to do data processing first format the data in such a way that you ML algo understand, in the processing stage you do not want to lose any useful information so you have put extra measure, manual analysis and data analysis utilizing your statistics knowledge, work experience, domain experience etc. Hence you would spend 80% of your time cleaning the data and preparing them. Rest 20% would be to apply ML and deploying the solution.

After all of these, if you can answer the question above based on the data, which could save your company/clients/customers millions of dollars from the fraudulent transactions or getting new clients based on the products you have recommended, that's when you have applied all your knowledge and expertise to do data science.

I thought this might help you see what to expect from this path. Hope this answers your question.",https://www.quora.com/Is-Machine-Learning-a-good-choice-for-a-career?top_ans=33425427,2016-12-30T11:42:46.921024+00:00,2018-10-12T15:59:08.419906+00:00,590,Bikash Debnath,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bikash-Debnath

Why? Because the companies that use that job title are the ones that have a very clear idea about how and why they want to utilize machine learning. In addition, these companies almost invariously have data scientists as well, so they have defined the distinction between the two.

Data scientist is a job title that’s often poorly defined. It’s usually an analyst that knows some programming and machine learning. A machine learning engineer is a full-blown software engineer that has specialized in machine learning.

The most important responsibilities of a machine learning engineer are roughly these:

 * Running machine learning experiments using a programming language with machine learning libraries.
 * Deploying machine learning solutions into production.
 * Optimizing solutions for performance and scalability.
 * Data engineering, i.e. ensuring a good data flow between database and backend systems.
 * Implementing custom machine learning code.

What's the work-life balance like for a machine learning engineer?,"According to me, it’s not really different from other software engineers who aren’t into machine learning. Yes, the learning curve for machine learning engineers might initially be steeper but it’s equally fun and exciting at the same time. Being an undergraduate student, I had a rough time initially getting into machine learning. I had to spend a lot of time outside the classes while teaching things to myself, especially math. But once I got used to it, it’s so much fun. Every day, I go back to my machine learning projects when I am really tired after finishing the regular stuff that I am required to do for college classes. Working on machine learning just refreshes me as I love it.

But it might not be the same for everyone. Especially if you are trying to get into machine learning just because it’s a highly paid field, I believe that your work-life balance would be a nightmare. Because if you are not really passionate about the field, you will end up spending more time finishing the tasks, which should be usually finished earlier. Also, the work will be much more stressful than it’s supposed to be. But if you love it, it’s no different than other computer scientists/data scientists/software engineers around.",https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-work-life-balance-like-for-a-machine-learning-engineer?top_ans=201446652,2020-03-04T17:10:05.245891+00:00,,1,Vivek Khimani,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vivek-Khimani
What is your life like as a machine learning engineer?,"Most of the work of me and my team in the past were working with 3 topics:

1. Data - how to move, transform and store data at large quantities. More is more with data. Even most of the data has no value now because they are messy, unreliable, repetitive or simply wrong, you don’t know which one are the god one. So you keep all of them and work with all of them.
2. Algorithms and their implementations - algorithms are important. They are core of all ML. ML engineers usually does not develop algorithms, but they implement them. The right hyper-parameters, the faster data feeding process is the critical part of the AI system.
3. Automation - making all the data-wrangling, training and deployment into production manually is boring and very risky process. Human error is normal and something you should expect. Automation is the key. The best result is when you have fully automated pipeline from source data to application on production system. When that happen you can celebrate. But don’t expect it will last more than 30 second. Then some new data format, new master data in some feeding systems and pipeline is broken.

What's the work-life balance like as an engineer in Germany?,"The work part

 * Salary-wise - it’s lower than the US in general, but it’s decent enough to have a comfortable life in Germany since the living costs are low compared to most highly developed countries.
 * Work contract - As Quora User has answered, there are two types of contracts in Germany - Tarif (group negotiated) or Aussertarif (individually negotiated). Under Tarif, you’re well protected by a work union such as IG Metall or alike. However, an outside-tariff salary is also desirable. You get more base salary than the tariff workers. Managers or senior engineers / scientists usually fall into this category.
 * Tax rate - As a single, the disposable income ratio is one of the lowest in the world. (Producing more kids would solve this problem ;) ) We worked both in Canada and Germany and the income tax rates are comparable with a kid. You can expect an income tax rate between 25%~35% from a junior software engineer to a senior software engineer/scientist in Germany, depending on your salary.
 * Healthcare / public pension - it’s a complex topic, so I won’t go into detail. You can expect around 17% to be taken from your salary by default. After this, you can see why the disposable income in Germany is so low.
 * As for working hours, if you’re under tariff, you only need to work the hours agreed upon in your contract. If you’re outside tariff, it still doesn’t mean you have to work your ass off. It often means you cannot build up overtime hours over a long window but instead use them up on a weekly or monthly basis.
 * 30 vacation days a year + overtime hours you’ve built up through the year. If you’re under the biggest work union IG-Metall, you can also get 6 or 8 more vacation days if you have a kid under age of 8.
The life part

 * Language - Most engineers have a very good command of English. In my previous company and the current company in Stuttgart, all official emails are in English and German. And meetings are usually held in English esp. if a non-German speaker is present. However, this may vary from company to company.
 * Outdoor activities and nature - Amazing, probably only after Scandinavian countries + New Zealand :) The country is very friendly to cyclists, hikers and skiers. It’s also the decision point why we chose Germany over Canada. However, Germans wouldn’t understand this part. :p If you love outdoor activities, Germany is a wonderful place for you.
 * Free time - You get lots of free time compared to North America. So you definitely need to learn to plan your free time, for example, overcoming seven summits or alike.
 * Education - Free school/university education. Oftentimes, PhD positions are paid like a regular employee
 * Healthcare - there’s no universal healthcare but a two-class system. There are multiple public healthcare and private providers. Private insurance companies usually provide a better coverage and as an engineer, you probably are qualified to choose a private one.
 * If you’re an introvert, and you like to reason with people and rationalize things based on rules and orders, this is the right place for you. Otherwise you’ll feel miserable.
I can go on and on, but you get the idea.",https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-work-life-balance-like-for-a-machine-learning-engineer?top_ans=234254511,2020-08-20T06:35:49.240557+00:00,2020-08-20T06:43:07.775396+00:00,58,Nicole Finnie,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nicole-Finnie
How is work/life balanced for data scientists?,"Outside California, the work-life balance is pretty good overall. I've had normal working hours with some overtime that I typically initiate. There's flexibility to work from home at least some days for many companies, and many companies provide generous benefits (medical, dental, life insurance, as well as emergency loan funds for employees facing unforeseen bills) and vacation time. R&D positions and large non-tech businesses are good options, particularly in the Midwest and South (where people are generally friendlier and more generous anyway).

Silicon Valley has a very bad reputation for a Bro Culture, in which workers are expected and rewarded for working insane hours and not seeing their families (or even having them--it is horrible for women there).",https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-work-life-balance-like-for-a-machine-learning-engineer?top_ans=59388031,2017-10-09T15:38:44.062446+00:00,,21,Anonymous,
How does a typical day for someone working in Machine Learning look like?," * Wake up.
 * Stumble into the office.
 * Mess around with some completely useless proof-of-concept in Jupyter Notebook that will never see the light of day in production.
 * Go for a good, long lunch.
 * Hang around the coffee machine and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of deep learning frameworks you’ve never used beyond tutorials.
 * Participate in random strategy meeting.
 * Continue on the notebook.
 * Try to fix your Python environment, which is in dependency hell after you installed some package that you’ll never use.
 * Give up and surf job boards instead.
 * Go home.
Although this is not my typical day (not most days anyway), it’s not too far from the truth for a lot of people. The harsh reality is that many, probably most, people working in machine learning are only doing irrelevant work that will never be used.

There could be several reasons for this. They may not have the right skills to succeed. They may be too early in their career to be trusted with real projects yet. But most of the time, it’s because there is a disconnect between what management thinks their data scientists should be doing and what they actually could be doing to make themselves useful.

There is still a ton of confusion in industry about how to leverage machine learning to generate value. Many companies that think they are data-driven, really aren’t. And that has resulted in armies of underutilized data scientists.

Why is machine learning regarded as the best career?,"The label of being the “best career” that is attributed to Machine Learning is definitely undeserved. It all stems from one word; hype.

“WHAT!” scream the millions of deep learning enthusiasts and ML engineers waiting in the wings.

Let me explain before pitchforks are raised.


There is no doubt Machine Learning is an interesting field to be in. It’s not only intellectually stimulating, its results appear near magic to the general public. Machines beating the world’s best at Go, self driving cars, Snapchats face filters. It’s sexy to be a Machine Learning engineer, to be involved in the very real wave of new technologies.


But there comes a point where the public greatly over values a profession. News articles such as the New York Times’ listing salaries of 300 - 500k for AI professionals [1] lead young graduates to believe Machine Learning is the best way to make big money. The problem begins when people start to pursue a career in Machine Learning because it’s the supposed “best career”. Combine this with the fact the field is so vaguely defined, encompassing everything from Data Engineers to statisticians to quantitative analysts with Python and you have a misinformed public and a ballooned valuation.


Since the field is so young, there are massive shortages in graduates educated with the relevant skills. As a result, salaries have of course rocketed. However, just a few years behind, the Universities of the world are starting more and more “Data Science” and “Machine Learning” degree programmes. Surely, this is the answer to the job shortage problem? Not quite. Because the field’s value is so distorted universities across the globe are starting sub par programmes which receive buckets of applications from (genuinely interested) students. These programmes make nice money for the university but only make the problem worse. Thousands of graduates now qualified as “Machine Learning experts” are under equipped for the task necessary, further clouding the definition of Machine Learning field. You can bet that in the years to come, when ML has stabilised, so too will the salaries and only those who are truly interested in the field will find their jobs fulfilling.


The real message I want to communicate in this answer is not that Machine Learning is overly hyped. My main message is that there is no such thing as “the best career”. There is only “the best career for you”. The most important thing to remember (just like for any job, however publicly valuable) is to honestly assess whether you have a genuine interest in the subject. Do you love playing with data and ML algorithms? Do you find the underlying math beautiful? Machine Learning is a fascinating field and, if it's right for you, it's rewarding, fulfilling and you can make some decent money doing it. But it's important to isolate the publics opinions from your own.

How do I find work-life balance?,"There is no such thing as work-life balance at any given instant.

Let’s look at Raj and Simran. They are both software engineers living in Silicon Valley. They got married when they were in their early twenties after quite a bit of drama involving a mean dad looking out for his daughter, a goofy dad looking out for his son and a train that could just as well not have had the other doors… But I digress…

After the hard fought marriage, Raj and Simran decided to move to California to start their professional lives and careers. They are young and dynamic and have the energy of youth on their side. They both spend 80% of their time at work. Raj absolutely loves his job; he finds the problems he’s working on so challenging and rewarding that the more time he spends working on them, the happier he is. Simran works with some of the smartest people on the planet. Every day she learns something new and grows a little. She looks forward to Monday mornings and puts her blood, sweat and tears into her job. Because they are so committed to their work, both Raj and Simran have been accelerating their way up the corporate ladder. They are HAPPY.

Fast forward a couple of years. They just had a baby. Simran decides to take a couple of years off from work and spend time raising her child. She wants to be there for his every need and chose not to send him to a nanny or a day care at that tender young age because she didn’t want to miss out on those precious moments. She put her career on hold and prioritized her family. Raj took a couple of months of paternity leave to help out with the baby. For the next two years, he spent about 50% of his time at work instead of the 80% he used to. But at this stage he had already grown and understood the workings of the job and even though he spent fewer hours at work, he was just as productive. He had learned how to make the most optimized use of his time and his career continued to grow at a steady pace. They are HAPPY.

When the little kid was old enough to start pre-school, Simran decided to get back to work. She started spending about 70% of her time at work really powering through her job and enjoying every second of it. Raj was extremely supportive and pulled his weight so that Simran could catch her career up to speed. They worked well together as a cohesive unit and played off each others’ strengths. Simran is very ambitious and career oriented and wanted to continue to climb the ladder. Raj decides that he’s at a comfortable spot for the time being and trades off a slice of his pie so that Simran could chase hers. He spends more of his time caring for their growing child and aging parents. This works out well for both of them. They are HAPPY.

If you take any point in time here, you see that Raj and Simran have no work-life balance whatsoever. They are either over-indexing on work or on family and each is costing and impacting the other. But if you step back and look at the picture more holistically; if you average it out over say a decade, you notice that they have indeed balanced work and life very well.

The mistake that people often seem to make is trying to optimize for the local maxima instead of the global maxima. Most folks seem to be chasing the short-term win when instead they should be focussing on how to average it out over a spread duration.

Everything in life is a function of prioritization. At different stages in your life, different things will matter to you. You can’t always try to balance every aspect of it. If you do, you will always be a solid average at everything. Understand what is important to you and why. Strategize for the long-term instead of only being tactical for the short-term. And most importantly, realize that there is no one-size-fits-all definition of work-life balance. Each of us need to define what this term means for us and work towards optimizing it. The simplest part of the algorithm is that we are in complete control of both parameters and are free to tweak them however we like. Naturally the tweaking comes with consequences just like any good model; the art of learning to optimize your bias and variance is what will set you apart and give you optimal results.


Employees who believe that they have a good work-life balance work 21% harder than those who don’t. They are HAPPY.

I have 4 years of experience as a software developer. Is it hard to switch my career to machine learning engineer?,"I did that. Worked as a Java engineer building distributed applications in the cloud for several years. This experience was invaluable for changing over into applied machine learning.

I would even say that several years of software engineering experience are a better foundation for applied machine learning than theoretical ML in academia because an ML engineer won’t develop novel algorithms from scratch.

You are much more concerned with building the software infrastructure that makes an ML model run in production.

The conceptual and practical skills you bring from typical software engineering jobs such as object-oriented design, working knowledge of various software architectures, a propensity to separate concerns and avoid coupling, CI/CD, DevOps, and good knowledge of databases are going to be more useful for designing production ML pipelines than understanding eigenvalue decompositions, or the partial derivatives involved in gradient descent.

Of course, you will need a high-level knowledge of various machine learning models and when they are appropriate.

What's a machine learning career like?,"I hate to see this question get so few answers. I don’t qualify myself as having a career in machine learning as I don’t spend the majority of my time researching algorithms on a theoretical level. I do, however, have a career that involves machine learning in practice, and I’ll describe that for you. As a Data Scientist, I would describe my career as:

 * Fun - Solving problems are just plain fun. I like to think of a data science problem like a Nintendo game: Some parts can be very frustrating and make you want to quit, but if you power through it, you get to enjoy the fun of beating the game.
 * Interesting - Following how a problem is solved from start to finish is very appealing to those interested in STEM fields. The feeling is comparable to eating your favorite chips, once you get one piece of information, you have to have more until you have to tell yourself to stop. And then have another anyway.
 * Exciting - In data science and machine learning in particular, new approaches are being introduced almost every day. This makes you realize how incredible it is to be a part of an era where technology is making advances we couldn’t have fathomed even 10 years ago. This thrill can make you feel as if you are a part of an elite group that has been appointed to change the world. You might not contribute a whole lot, but you know you’re included.
 * Confusing - When researching a topic, it’s more often than not where you come across something that just won’t stick the first time around. While some concepts might take minutes for others to understand, you might scratch your head for two full days before it truly sinks in. But when it does.. You realize why it was worth it. It’s like being young, having a crush send you mixed signals, and then one day they finally tell you they like you.
 * Different - A career in this field can sometimes make you wonder how 9–5 jobs even exist. You think to yourself I’ve spent 4 weeks on this problem and it doesn’t feel like I’ve made any progress. And then you compare it to a summer job you had when you were younger and recall that most jobs have an immediate turn around on value. They work to provide a service. Now I’m working to generate a solution and there is absolutely no standard on how long it might take.
I would say that if any of this sounds intriguing to you then you should hop on the train. Like I said, you don’t have to contribute a whole lot, but simply being a part of it all makes it worth your time.

What's the work-life balance like as an engineer in Germany?,"If you have a good work contract with an employer who sticks to the Tarife, such as a big company like Thyssen, BMW, or Zeiss, your work week could be as short as 35 hours, five days a week, and you would have six weeks of paid holiday every year.

The working day tends to begin earlier in Germany than in the English speaking world, especially in industry, so don’t be surprised if you are expected to man your station by 07:00. The good news is, you might be on your way home by 15:00 Monday to Thursday, and by 12:00 on Fridays or you do the whole week of 07:00–14:30. That’s if you take a half hour lunch break.

I spent some time at ZF, and that’s how we worked there.

Careful though, you could also end up with an aussertariflich contract, and then, it’s free for all. I used to be on one of those once, and oh boy. Still got my six weeks off paid a year, but there were weeks when I worked 72 hours, no extra compensation. Sometimes nights, sometimes weekends, nobody cared if I lived or died.

What exactly does a machine learning engineer do?,"The role of a machine learning engineer is actually much better defined than that of a data scientist.

Why? Because the companies that use that job title are the ones that have a very clear idea about how and why they want to utilize machine learning. In addition, these companies almost invariously have data scientists as well, so they have defined the distinction between the two.

Data scientist is a job title that’s often poorly defined. It’s usually an analyst that knows some programming and machine learning. A machine learning engineer is a full-blown software engineer that has specialized in machine learning.

The most important responsibilities of a machine learning engineer are roughly these:

 * Running machine learning experiments using a programming language with machine learning libraries.
 * Deploying machine learning solutions into production.
 * Optimizing solutions for performance and scalability.
 * Data engineering, i.e. ensuring a good data flow between database and backend systems.
 * Implementing custom machine learning code.
 * Data science, i.e. analyzing data and coming up with use cases.

What are the benefits of pursuing a career in machine learning?,"Are you serious?

Here are a few reasons I love my job.

1. Make more than most doctors.
2. Work remotely 100% of the time.
3. Work with really smart people.
4. Not a lot of human interaction. Very few meetings.
5. A total package like C level execs. (Bonus, sick leave, paid time off)
6. For the most part, I make my own hours. I’m not a morning person so I block off my calendar so other’s can’t set up meetings at 8am. I’m still sleeping then and don’t want to be interrupted.
7. Tons of jobs. If I don’t like my job for any reason, I move on.
8. A career for life. At 50, I’ll never not have job in this space. Ever.
9. Highly respected. This career is one of the most technical and respected in all of IT.
Those are a few reasons that make machine learning a great career.

Now, don’t kid yourself. I’ve been working with data and BI for 20 years. You won’t be in a MLE role in a few months and not likely in a few years but I wouldn’t change a thing.

Although this is not my typical day (not most days anyway), it’s not too far from the truth for a lot of people. The harsh reality is that many, probably most, people working in machine learning are only doing irrelevant work that will never be used.

There could be several reasons for this. They may not have the right skills to succeed. They may be too early in their career to be trusted with real projects yet. But most of the time, it’s because there is a disconnect between what management thinks their data scientists should be doing and what they actually could be doing to make themselves useful.

There is still a ton of confusion in industry about how to leverage machine learning to generate value. Many companies that think they are data-driven, really aren’t.

What do machine learning engineers do on a daily basis?,"Hi, ML engineer here.

Currently working on NLP, for the most part, including intent classification and entity extraction.

Here’s a typical day for me:

Get to work, pull up GitHub and check on the ZenHub board (kind of like Jira, except way cooler). I had some models that were training last night on our servers and I should have gotten an email that they finished. I did!

I’ll probably spend a few minutes testing those new models and then tweak some parameters, then restart the training process.

The rest of the day I’m usually head-down coding, either working on a back-end Python application that will supply the AI for one of our products, or implementing a new algorithm that I want to try out.

For example, recently I read a paper on coupled simulated annealing (CSA), [ http://ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/sdesouza/papers/CSA2009accepted.pdf ] and I wanted to try it out on tuning the parameters for XGBoost as an alternative to a grid search. CSA is a generalized form of simulated annealing (SA), which is an algorithm for optimizing a function that doesn’t use any information on the derivative of the function.

Unfortunately I couldn’t find an implementation in Python, so I decided to write my own. Two days later, I had submitted my first package to PyPI!

Anyways… I’ve actually never met another ML engineer, so I have no idea if my daily experience is typical ;-) Did I miss anything?

What does a Machine Learning software engineer do?,"With the rapid growth of machine learning usage in industry, it’s becoming harder and harder to answer this question. In the past, a machine learning engineer at a company would be in charge of creating the architecture for machine learning models, as well as the training and deployment pipelines.

While this is still true nowadays, many companies have expanded their definition of machine learning engineers to also include tasks such as data processing, data analysis, and feature engineering. When I was at Google and Microsoft, many of the ML engineers I worked with spent a majority of their time playing around with data and hyperparameter tuning.

There are now even specializations of the machine learning engineer role (which itself is a specialization of the overarching software engineer role). Companies that want to apply machine learning to text or video data will likely hire natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision (CV) engineers, respectively. For examples, companies in the autonomous vehicles space (e.g. Uber, Cruise) will hire entire teams of CV engineers and scientists.

Due to the continuously developing definition of machine learning engineers in industry, it is becoming more and more difficult for companies to find the right ones for their particular role.

What do machine learning engineers do?,"The role of a Machine Learning Engineer is a marriage between two pivotal roles in the industry – Data Scientists and Software Engineer. A Software Engineer primarily focuses on programming (writing code), while the core focus of a Data Scientist is to experiment with Big Data. Both roles are inherently different. Software Engineers are expert coders/programmers who write scalable programs and design software systems for companies. To them, the whole concept of ML seems distant, whereas job of a Data Scientist is more analytical as they use a combination of mathematical, statistical, analytical skills and ML tools to gather, process, and analyze massive datasets to gain insights.

This is precisely why companies felt a need for a Machine Learning Engineer – a professional who can bring the best of both worlds to the table. Organizations wanted someone who can demystify the Data Scientists’ code and make it more useful and accessible. Machine Learning Engineers combine the laws and rules of the Data Science world with that of programming to help organizations reap the full benefits of AI/ML technologies while adhering to the standard programming practices and protocols.

What does a Machine Learning Engineer do?

Both Machine Learning Engineers and Data SThe job of a Machine Learning Engineer is quite similar to that of a Data Scientist, in the sense that both roles involve working with vast volumes of data. scientists must possess excellent data management skills. Machine Learning Engineers focus on designing self-running software for predictive model automation whereas Data Scientists are mainly concerned with generating valuable insights for driving business growth through data-oriented decision making. In such models, each time the software performs a function, it uses the results of that operation to perform future operations with greater accuracy. This makes up the “learning” process of the software. Best examples of this type of intelligent software are Recommendation Engines Netflix and Amazon. Machine Learning Engineers ensure that the models used by Data Scientists can ingest vast amounts of real-time data for generating more accurate results. And also, work in close collaboration with Data Scientists. While Data Scientists extract meaningful insights from large datasets and communicate the information to business stakeholders.

What does a machine learning engineer’s work entail?,"Original Question: What does a machine learning engineer’s work entail?

Probably I’m behind the times, but working on Machine Learning (ML) projects isn’t much different than any other code: Input(s) -%3E process -%3E output(s) -%3E repeat. There have been programs written whose operation has relied on prior or collected data for many decades.

Unlike Deep Learning (DL), where the “experience” data is determined ahead of applying it to the application code, ML mostly gathers the “prior” data while the application is running.

Engineering wise, that means designing the hardware and writing the software to be able to collect, analyze, integrate and act upon the appropriate data as the application is running.

My experience has been in designing supervised ML (human set up) embedded (microcontroller based) industrial control subsystems and test equipment. Once installed, the ML code would automatically compensate for wear and improve operation with use. What I’ve written here is generally applicable to ML projects embedded or not.

Collecting data is a combination of hardware and software. The ML engineer has to determine what inputs (sensors, serial communication, user buttons, etc. are needed to do the job. Some input sources and/or sensor(s) have to provide measures to the ML agent for improving/maintaining operation. Building an ML thermostat would certainly require a temperature sensor and some user input button(s).

Analyzing the data means authenticating what has been input. For serial or parallel data reception that may include parity, checksum, etc. For reading an analog input that may mean range and rate-of-change testing. Some way to determine if the current data is for real, then signaling, logging and ignoring if it isn’t.

Integrating the current data is where the Artificial Intelligence (AI) can come in (although not always needed). Often Bayesian in origin, your program code will compare the prior data collected against the current input(s). If needed it will then change some internal offset/factor to normalize operation. In some applications, a novel input is added to a table as new “prior” data to compare to.

Action will then be taken to change an output device(s) state to improve the system’s operation. That may occur when a threshold is reached or due to a specific combination of input readings.

Well, that is my take on ML from the embedded engineer’s perspective. Here is an application example of ML and DL combined:

What do machine learning engineers actually do?,"I would say that the work of Machine Learning engineer can be divided into three major chunks :
1. Almost all Machine Learning algorithms have implementations available, one important task is to pick what algorithm is to be used for a task. (for example decide whether DBSCAN or K-Means is more suitable for a clustering problem, or which out of MaxEnt/CRF is better for NLP tagging).
2. Feature Engineering is another important part of the job. The raw data generally cant be fed to the algorithms above directly. This might require performing analysis over data, pre-processing it, dimensionality reduction and things like that. This takes the major chunk of time.

The combination of two tasks, reiterated many times, finally leads to good results. We might need to pivot on algorithm and feature extraction many times .

What do machine learning engineers do on a daily basis?,"Hi, ML engineer here.

Currently working on NLP, for the most part, including intent classification and entity extraction.

Here’s a typical day for me:

Get to work, pull up GitHub and check on the ZenHub board (kind of like Jira, except way cooler). I had some models that were training last night on our servers and I should have gotten an email that they finished. I did!

I’ll probably spend a few minutes testing those new models and then tweak some parameters, then restart the training process.

The rest of the day I’m usually head-down coding, either working on a back-end Python application that will supply the AI for one of our products, or implementing a new algorithm that I want to try out.

For example, recently I read a paper on coupled simulated annealing (CSA), [ http://ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/sdesouza/papers/CSA2009accepted.pdf ] and I wanted to try it out on tuning the parameters for XGBoost as an alternative to a grid search. CSA is a generalized form of simulated annealing (SA), which is an algorithm for optimizing a function that doesn’t use any information on the derivative of the function.

Unfortunately I couldn’t find an implementation in Python, so I decided to write my own. Two days later, I had submitted my first package to PyPI!

Anyways… I’ve actually never met another ML engineer, so I have no idea if my daily experience is typical ;-) Did I miss anything? Bagel Fridays are awesome because I’m the only who likes everything bagels. Must be a New York thing? (Currently in the middle of Iowa, not to be confused with Idaho. We have CORN, not the potatoes).",https://www.quora.com/What-do-machine-learning-engineers-do-on-a-daily-basis?top_ans=49251884,2017-07-03T02:44:35.600565+00:00,2017-07-03T02:48:30.467778+00:00,9,Evan Pete Walsh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Evan-Pete-Walsh

What does a Machine Learning software engineer do?,"With the rapid growth of machine learning usage in industry, it’s becoming harder and harder to answer this question. In the past, a machine learning engineer at a company would be in charge of creating the architecture for machine learning models, as well as the training and deployment pipelines.

While this is still true nowadays, many companies have expanded their definition of machine learning engineers to also include tasks such as data processing, data analysis, and feature engineering. When I was at Google and Microsoft, many of the ML engineers I worked with spent a majority of their time playing around with data and hyperparameter tuning.

There are now even specializations of the machine learning engineer role (which itself is a specialization of the overarching software engineer role). Companies that want to apply machine learning to text or video data will likely hire natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision (CV) engineers, respectively. For examples, companies in the autonomous vehicles space (e.g. Uber, Cruise) will hire entire teams of CV engineers and scientists.

Due to the continuously developing definition of machine learning engineers in industry, it is becoming more and more difficult for companies to find the right ones for their particular role. During my day-to-day work at AdaptiLab [ http://www.adaptilab.com ], I deal with plenty of hiring managers facing this issue.

What do machine learning engineers do?,"The role of a Machine Learning Engineer is a marriage between two pivotal roles in the industry – Data Scientists and Software Engineer. A Software Engineer primarily focuses on programming (writing code), while the core focus of a Data Scientist is to experiment with Big Data. Both roles are inherently different. Software Engineers are expert coders/programmers who write scalable programs and design software systems for companies. To them, the whole concept of ML seems distant, whereas job of a Data Scientist is more analytical as they use a combination of mathematical, statistical, analytical skills and ML tools to gather, process, and analyze massive datasets to gain insights.

This is precisely why companies felt a need for a Machine Learning Engineer – a professional who can bring the best of both worlds to the table. Organizations wanted someone who can demystify the Data Scientists’ code and make it more useful and accessible. Machine Learning Engineers combine the laws and rules of the Data Science world with that of programming to help organizations reap the full benefits of AI/ML technologies while adhering to the standard programming practices and protocols.

What does a Machine Learning Engineer do?

Both Machine Learning Engineers and Data SThe job of a Machine Learning Engineer is quite similar to that of a Data Scientist, in the sense that both roles involve working with vast volumes of data. scientists must possess excellent data management skills. Machine Learning Engineers focus on designing self-running software for predictive model automation whereas Data Scientists are mainly concerned with generating valuable insights for driving business growth through data-oriented decision making. In such models, each time the software performs a function, it uses the results of that operation to perform future operations with greater accuracy. This makes up the “learning” process of the software. Best examples of this type of intelligent software are Recommendation Engines Netflix and Amazon. Machine Learning Engineers ensure that the models used by Data Scientists can ingest vast amounts of real-time data for generating more accurate results. And also, work in close collaboration with Data Scientists. While Data Scientists extract meaningful insights from large datasets and communicate the information to business stakeholders.

Skills Required to be a Machine Learning Engineer

 * Excellent interpersonal and collaboration skills.
 * Advanced degree in Computer Science/Math/Statistics or a related discipline.
 * Strong written and verbal communications
 * Advanced Math and Statistics skills (linear algebra, calculus, Bayesian statistics, mean, median, variance, etc.)
 * Experience in working with various ML libraries and packages like Scikit learn, Theano, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Caffe, etc.
 * Robust data modelling and data architecture skills.
 * Experience in working with ML frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
 * Programming experience in Python, R, Java, C++, etc.
Responsibilities of a Machine Learning Engineer

 * To explore and visualize data for better understanding and identify differences in data distribution that could impact model performance when deploying it in real-world scenarios.
 * To study and convert data science prototypes.
 * To analyze the problem-solving capabilities and use-cases of ML algorithms and rank them by their success probability.

What does a machine learning engineer’s work entail?,"Original Question: What does a machine learning engineer’s work entail?

Probably I’m behind the times, but working on Machine Learning (ML) projects isn’t much different than any other code: Input(s) -%3E process -%3E output(s) -%3E repeat. There have been programs written whose operation has relied on prior or collected data for many decades.

Unlike Deep Learning (DL), where the “experience” data is determined ahead of applying it to the application code, ML mostly gathers the “prior” data while the application is running.

Engineering wise, that means designing the hardware and writing the software to be able to collect, analyze, integrate and act upon the appropriate data as the application is running.

My experience has been in designing supervised ML (human set up) embedded (microcontroller based) industrial control subsystems and test equipment. Once installed, the ML code would automatically compensate for wear and improve operation with use. What I’ve written here is generally applicable to ML projects embedded or not.

Collecting data is a combination of hardware and software. The ML engineer has to determine what inputs (sensors, serial communication, user buttons, etc. are needed to do the job. Some input sources and/or sensor(s) have to provide measures to the ML agent for improving/maintaining operation. Building an ML thermostat would certainly require a temperature sensor and some user input button(s).

Analyzing the data means authenticating what has been input. For serial or parallel data reception that may include parity, checksum, etc. For reading an analog input that may mean range and rate-of-change testing. Some way to determine if the current data is for real, then signaling, logging and ignoring if it isn’t.

Integrating the current data is where the Artificial Intelligence (AI) can come in (although not always needed). Often Bayesian in origin, your program code will compare the prior data collected against the current input(s). If needed it will then change some internal offset/factor to normalize operation. In some applications, a novel input is added to a table as new “prior” data to compare to.

Action will then be taken to change an output device(s) state to improve the system’s operation. That may occur when a threshold is reached or due to a specific combination of input readings.

Well, that is my take on ML from the embedded engineer’s perspective. Here is an application example of ML and DL combined:

What do machine learning engineers actually do?,"I would say that the work of Machine Learning engineer can be divided into three major chunks :
1. Almost all Machine Learning algorithms have implementations available, one important task is to pick what algorithm is to be used for a task. (for example decide whether DBSCAN or K-Means is more suitable for a clustering problem, or which out of MaxEnt/CRF is better for NLP tagging).
2. Feature Engineering is another important part of the job. The raw data generally cant be fed to the algorithms above directly. This might require performing analysis over data, pre-processing it, dimensionality reduction and things like that. This takes the major chunk of time.

The combination of two tasks, reiterated many times, finally leads to good results. We might need to pivot on algorithm and feature extraction many times .


3. Staying abreast of latest development is also important. This field is one of the hottest research areas and newer and better algorithms are being invented.

What is the typical day of a software engineer like?,"Hmmm…well, for me (as a senior game programmer), it goes like this:

I get to work early (7am) because I’m a “morning person” - but most of my co-workers don’t get to work until 9 or 10am. We have “flex time” - so long as we’re there between 10am and 4pm and work 40 hours a week - we come and go as we please.

We have a fully-stocked (free!) kitchen, so I’ll grab a coffee and a breakfast snack (we usually have cereal, bagles, energy bars and fruit available), I’ll check email while I munch, and then settle into working on whatever programming task I left off of doing the previous day.

At 10am, we have “scrum” (aka “standup”) where the team gather around the “scrum board”. Our boss tells us any management-type news from the previous day - then we go around the team with each person describing what they did the previous day - and what they plan to do today - they’ll also explain any “blockers” that are preventing them from doing something. There may be BRIEF discussion of this…but brief. The whole thing gets done in 15 minutes.

For team leaders (like me) we may run a “scrum-of-scrums” where the team leaders gather around the scrum board and each of us summarizes what they just heard from their team so all of the teams have some idea what each other are up to.

When scrum is done, we’ll generally socialize for 10 or 15 minutes then break up and get to work. People will wander off to the break room sporadically for snacks, sodas or coffee. Sometimes we’ll get little pop-up meetings around someone’s desk when there is a problem that needs ironing out. Since everyone is now concentrating hard on their work, we try hard to avoid distractions. We’ll often communicate with the person sitting next to us using email or a chat room to avoid distracting other people with chatter.

Some people get together for lunch - find a nearby restaurant. Other times people will grab food and eat at their desks while they work or just hang out together. Team members are also friends…and perhaps also “family”.

Often people need a short distraction from their work - and many companies have things like pool tables or video games in the break room for people to socialize during work hours. You can’t do this to excess - but nobody cares if you do this for a half hour here and there. We recognize that putting in 8 hours of 100% concentration is impossible.

There will often be meetings - everyone grabs their laptop and head off to a nearby meeting room…some of these will be scheduled - such as our “sprint planning” and “sprint retrospective” meetings that happen every two weeks…others will be things that come up that need discussion with a group of people. Some days are (mercifully) meeting-free, others are so jammed with meetings that it’s tough to get work done at all.

It’s not all work - there will often be protracted silly discussions on the chatline - management will often have things like free lunches, after-work parties, going out of the office together to see some new movie - or to do a round of mini-golf or whatever. There are typically half a dozen of those events spread through the year. Put this down to “team building”. We also have “happy hour” on Friday - everyone grabs a beer (we have a “beer fridge” in the office!) and we sit around and chew the fat. Some of this may be tech stuff - but often it’s just general geek-chat.

I get done with work by about 4pm (because I start at 7am and take an hour for lunch) - but the people who come in at 9 or 10 will work until 6 or 7pm. I NEVER answer work emails or chats when I’m out of the office - but some people do.

Dress code is “you must wear clothing” - and shorts and T-shirts or jeans and sweatshirt with trainers or sandals is common. One guy I know dresses in “SteamPunk” gear - and nobody bats an eyelid at that!

Our desks are generally either in cubes or in open work areas - we don’t often get offices. Most programmers have two large monitors and either a state-of-the-art laptop or a big, heavy, fully-loaded laptop. We get to pick our own keyboards and mice. If we’re working on console development, there will be another monitor with an Xbox or Playstation (maybe both!) with the necessary controllers. So we need LARGE desks.

People listen to music or whatever on headphones - so the office is *QUIET*. People who have audio coming from phones and PC speakers suffer an immediate and horrible death! If you have to make a phone call - you go out into the corridor to do it.

Because we use “agile development”, work tends to fall into 2 week “sprints” - which start out with optimism and enthusiasm for new tasks that we’re getting into - they tend to lull a bit in the middle - and there is typically frenetic activity towards the end of the sprint as tasks get finished up and checked into our revision control system.

This sets a “rhythm” to work that our families gradually adapt to…my wife knows that I may be late home towards the end of the sprint - that I can totally relax and unwind in the weekend before the start of a new sprint - but may be somewhat absorbed and distracted with work concerns in the mid-sprint weekend. (I try not to do that…but it happens). We try to schedule vacations around the sprint structure.

In the game business, we often have to get our product “out the door” for a drop-dead deadline that gets the game onto the store shelves in time for Xmas. This is a “cannot miss” deadline. If the game doesn’t make it out for Xmas, it’ll either get pathetic sales for mid-year release - or it has to be delayed by an entire year, which would make it obsolete - and cost the company another year of salaries, which would make it unprofitable.

So if we slip behind schedule - we’ll be working crazy hours (we call it “Crunch time”) in the months leading up to the release date. In those times, people will sometimes be asked to work 50, 60 or even 70 hours a week…we’ll eat all of our meals at work, work through weekends, stop vacation time…this is unpaid overtime and it’s horrible.

Bad companies do this a lot - often to the point of abusing their staff - but there is a trend to avoid crunch-time as much as possible - and if a game is well-planned and professionally executed - it’s not necessary.

What’s the daily routine of a machine learning engineer (compared to data scientist and data engineer)?,"Machine Learning Engineers are looked at as some kind of wizards because of all the hype surrounding the field - the same way people used to look at data scientists a few years back.

What software engineers working in other fields of CS fail to realize is that it is very much alike any other programming job with maybe minor differences in the nature of the work.

In the case of Deep Learning, when working with fairly complex libraries like Tensorflow to train for, say, an object detection application, people might be thrown off balance from their normal work routines because, more often than not, the job demands constant attention to your neural network training processes. Especially when you are on a deadline, this becomes crucial and you can almost never say when you can converge at an optimal checkpoint if you are unsure about your model configuration (this happens quite a lot). Thus, you might have to work at odd-hours to ensure that you are constantly ploughing the field for the harvest.

There is much talk about auto-tuning of hyper-parameters through techniques like meta-learning (learning to learn) but apart from such very few techniques, intuitions and case-specific heuristics that help determine them, rest of the tuning has to be done in an arbitrary fashion. This is an annoying, exhausting and over-taxing loop which will drain your creative energy if you are not careful.

Also, as computational complexity of deeper neural networks are higher compared to their shallow counterparts, they take longer amounts of time to train especially if you are limited by low-end GPUs. During the training process, as much as it is difficult to interpret if your model is getting trained in the right direction, you are pushed to infer from certain subtle clues as to whether your current training configuration is working as you expect it should. The quicker you realize this, the sooner you can try out the second idea in your list.

The 80–20 rule also applies to ML. 80% of your pipeline can be setup in 20% of the time but 20% of the work takes the remaining 80% of your time. Although, this is always not the case, especially when you are not looking for peak accuracy numbers.

Having said all that, ML is simply an amazing field - not just because of all the hype but because of the sheer amount of learning it guarantees. It requires a combination of math and engineering skills to build something truly practical.

To answer your question, in short, we are much alike other software engineers and there is no specific activity in our routine that sets us apart from engineers working in other domains of CS.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-daily-schedule-of-a-machine-learning-engineer?top_ans=62443997,2017-11-07T09:56:43.629994+00:00,,22,Surya Prakash,https://www.quora.com/profile/Surya-Prakash-18
What is a general routine for a machine learning engineer?,"The routine of a machine learning engineer can vary depending on the specific company or project they are working on, but here is a general routine that a machine learning engineer might follow:

1. Problem formulation: This step involves working with stakeholders to identify a problem or opportunity that can be solved or improved using machine learning. Machine learning engineers need to have a good understanding of the business domain and the context in which the problem occurs. They should also define the problem and the success criteria for the solution, which can guide the development and evaluation of the machine learning model.

Feature engineering is a crucial step in machine learning, as the choice of features can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. Machine learning engineers need to have a good understanding of feature selection, feature extraction, and feature scaling techniques.
4. Model selection and development: This step involves selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm and developing a model that can solve the problem. Machine learning engineers need to have a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various machine learning algorithms, as well as how to implement them using programming languages such as Python or R. They should also know how to train and evaluate the model using the available data.
5. Model tuning: This step involves optimizing the model by tuning the hyperparameters and adjusting the model architecture to improve its performance. Machine learning engineers need to know how to use techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization to find the best hyperparameters for the model. They should also be able to adjust the model architecture to improve its performance, such as by adding or removing layers in a neural network.
6. Deployment: This step involves deploying the model in a production environment or integrating it into an existing system. Machine learning engineers need to know how to package the model as a REST API or other web service, and how to monitor the performance of the model in production. They should also be aware of the ethical and legal implications of deploying a machine learning model, such as data privacy and algorithmic bias.
7. Testing and evaluation: This step involves testing the model's performance on new data and evaluating its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. Machine learning engineers need to know how to design experiments to test the model's performance, and how to interpret the results of these experiments. They should also be aware of the limitations of the model and how to communicate these limitations to stakeholders.
8. Communication and reporting: This step involves communicating the results of the machine learning project to stakeholders and reporting on the progress and outcomes of the project. Machine learning engineers need to know how to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, and how to present data and visualizations that are easy to understand. They should also be able to provide recommendations for future work and improvements.
9. Continuous learning and improvement: This step involves keeping up with the latest developments in machine learning and continuously improving the model and the machine learning pipeline over time. Machine learning engineers should be aware of the latest research in machine learning and how to apply it to their work. They should also be open to feedback and willing to iterate on their work to improve the model's performance.
This routine involves a combination of technical skills, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. Machine learning engineers need to have a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques, as well as programming and data processing skills.

What exactly does a machine learning engineer do?,"The role of a machine learning engineer is actually much better defined than that of a data scientist.

Why? Because the companies that use that job title are the ones that have a very clear idea about how and why they want to utilize machine learning. In addition, these companies almost invariously have data scientists as well, so they have defined the distinction between the two.

Data scientist is a job title that’s often poorly defined. It’s usually an analyst that knows some programming and machine learning. A machine learning engineer is a full-blown software engineer that has specialized in machine learning.

The most important responsibilities of a machine learning engineer are roughly these:

 * Running machine learning experiments using a programming language with machine learning libraries.
 * Deploying machine learning solutions into production.
 * Optimizing solutions for performance and scalability.
 * Data engineering, i.e. ensuring a good data flow between database and backend systems.
 * Implementing custom machine learning code.

In the morning, I typically work on coding problems. In the afternoon, I like to shift to hardware issues.

What is your life like as a machine learning engineer?,"Most of the work of me and my team in the past were working with 3 topics:

1. Data - how to move, transform and store data at large quantities. More is more with data. Even most of the data has no value now because they are messy, unreliable, repetitive or simply wrong, you don’t know which one are the god one. So you keep all of them and work with all of them.
2. Algorithms and their implementations - algorithms are important. They are core of all ML. ML engineers usually does not develop algorithms, but they implement them. The right hyper-parameters, the faster data feeding process is the critical part of the AI system.
3. Automation - making all the data-wrangling, training and deployment into production manually is boring and very risky process. Human error is normal and something you should expect. Automation is the key. The best result is when you have fully automated pipeline from source data to application on production system. When that happen you can celebrate.

How can one become a good machine learning engineer?,"The other answers do a great job covering the technical aspects of this question, such as the fundamentals you need to learn, the courses you should take, the papers you should read etc. I'm going to cover this question from another angle and talk about the traits you need to have or be able to cultivate in order to be a good machine learning engineer. 

Here is a list of must-have traits, in no particular order:

 * You need to enjoy an iterative process of development. If you want to build a machine learning system, you need to be able to build a version 0.1 using a very simple model quickly. Then iterate on getting it better at every successive stage.
 * You also need to have a good intuition for when to stop. In any machine learning system, you can always improve the accuracy by iterating on it more. But at some point, the effort you put into it exceeds the value you derive from it. You need to be able to identify that point.
 * You should be comfortable with failure. A lot of your models and experiments will fail. And that’s ok.
 * You should be driven by curiosity. The best people are the ones who are genuinely curious about the world around them and channel that curiosity when working on machine learning.
 * You need to have a good data intuition. You should be good at identifying patterns in the data. Being able to create quick data visualizations (using R, Python, Matlab or Excel etc.) helps.
 * You need to have a good sense of metrics and be metrics-driven. You should to be able to establish metrics that define success or failure of your system. You should feel comfortable with blind experiments [1]  and terms like precision, recall, accuracy, ROC, conversion rates, NDCG etc.
 * Metrics are great at giving a high level view of how your system is doing. But at the same time, you should never stop directly looking at individual examples. Manually looking at your biggest wins and your biggest losses (e.g. worst performing queries for a search engine), as well as random samples of your data, teaches you a lot about your machine learning system that raw metrics don’t.
 * You should be able to develop a generalized approach to fixing the bugs/misclassifications in your models. Fixing individual bugs will only let you attain a local maxima. More often that not, individual fixes will also make your models more complex and harder to work with. Gathering all the issues together and identifying common themes will let you focus on the biggest impact issues that you can fix in your next round of iteration.
 * When developing your models, you should be able to put yourself in the minds of the users / customers of your system. It’s easy to build something that’s good enough for you. But your current and future users matter way more than you do. There are also a lot of biases [2] that affect individual decision making, and you should try to be aware of and account for as many of them as possible.

2. Feature Engineering is another important part of the job. The raw data generally cant be fed to the algorithms above directly. This might require performing analysis over data, pre-processing it, dimensionality reduction and things like that. This takes the major chunk of time.

The combination of two tasks, reiterated many times, finally leads to good results. We might need to pivot on algorithm and feature extraction many times .

"As a data scientist, how can I transition to be a machine learning engineer?","One of my great data science mentors, Rafal Lukawiecki, told me that every successful machine learning project needs three key people:

 * Data scientist
 * Data engineer
 * Domain expert
The data engineer is a person, let’s call him Bob, that is an expert on database systems and is a stronger programmer than the data scientist.

Rafal brings his Bob to all his projects. Whenever he needs to retrieve some data or set up a data pipeline, he calls on Bob for help, so that the data is available for Rafal to do his magic.

If you want to be a machine learning engineer, you need to fulfill the role of Bob yourself. You need to be able to develop end-to-end machine learning solutions and data pipelines. Everything from ingestion to transformation to storage to deployment. You’ll have less time to do the magic modelling. But that’s okay. The truth is that modelling itself is a small part of most machine learning projects in practice.

A good place to start would be to start taking on data engineering tasks. As a data scientist, this shouldn’t be too much of an issue. There are always data plumbing tasks that need to be performed and there are never enough data engineers to go around. As a specialized data scientist in a large organization, you can choose to avoid them, but as a machine learning engineer, you should embrace them.

One thing I would strongly recommend is that instead of holding on to your favorite data science tools like notebooks, Python and CSV files as the go-to solution for everything, start learning more powerful technologies so that you can use the right tool for the job. Learn how to use Spark, how to provision clusters and tear them down. Become really good at SQL and learn how to optimize queries and tune databases. Pick up a strongly typed general-purpose programming language like Java or C#. Learn about cloud technologies. Learn about big data architectures like Lambda, Kappa and Delta. Learn how to use streaming and event-driven systems to your advantage.

There are a lot of aspects to being a machine learning engineer. But the key takeaway is that you need to get it out of your head that you are this genius scientist that only spends time on math and modelling. Stop being a data science snob. You are a plumber, a hacker and a janitor. That versatility is exactly what most organizations need. Embrace that, and you will become a machine learning engineer.",https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-Machine-Learning-engineer-and-get-a-job-soon?top_ans=289185181,2021-06-14T12:52:11.039036+00:00,,560,Håkon Hapnes Strand,https://www.quora.com/profile/Håkon-Hapnes-Strand
How can one become a good machine learning engineer?,"The other answers do a great job covering the technical aspects of this question, such as the fundamentals you need to learn, the courses you should take, the papers you should read etc. I'm going to cover this question from another angle and talk about the traits you need to have or be able to cultivate in order to be a good machine learning engineer. 

Here is a list of must-have traits, in no particular order:

 * You need to enjoy an iterative process of development. If you want to build a machine learning system, you need to be able to build a version 0.1 using a very simple model quickly. Then iterate on getting it better at every successive stage.
 * You also need to have a good intuition for when to stop. In any machine learning system, you can always improve the accuracy by iterating on it more. But at some point, the effort you put into it exceeds the value you derive from it. You need to be able to identify that point.
 * You should be comfortable with failure. A lot of your models and experiments will fail. And that’s ok.
 * You should be driven by curiosity. The best people are the ones who are genuinely curious about the world around them and channel that curiosity when working on machine learning.
 * You need to have a good data intuition. You should be good at identifying patterns in the data. Being able to create quick data visualizations (using R, Python, Matlab or Excel etc.) helps.
 * You need to have a good sense of metrics and be metrics-driven. You should to be able to establish metrics that define success or failure of your system. You should feel comfortable with blind experiments [1]  and terms like precision, recall, accuracy, ROC, conversion rates, NDCG etc.
 * Metrics are great at giving a high level view of how your system is doing. But at the same time, you should never stop directly looking at individual examples. Manually looking at your biggest wins and your biggest losses (e.g. worst performing queries for a search engine), as well as random samples of your data, teaches you a lot about your machine learning system that raw metrics don’t.
 * You should be able to develop a generalized approach to fixing the bugs/misclassifications in your models. Fixing individual bugs will only let you attain a local maxima. More often that not, individual fixes will also make your models more complex and harder to work with. Gathering all the issues together and identifying common themes will let you focus on the biggest impact issues that you can fix in your next round of iteration.
 * When developing your models, you should be able to put yourself in the minds of the users / customers of your system. It’s easy to build something that’s good enough for you. But your current and future users matter way more than you do. There are also a lot of biases [2] that affect individual decision making, and you should try to be aware of and account for as many of them as possible.
This list was adapted from a blog post I wrote a while ago: What makes a good data scientist/engineer? [ https://medium.com/@nikhilbd/what-makes-a-good-data-scientist-engineer-a8b4d7948a86#.ylky30l9h ]

How can I get a machine learning job in 9 months?,"I can not give guarantee that you will get job in 9 months but I will tell you how to get in-depth knowledge in machine learning field. That will definately help you to get a job. Afterall getting job depends on how hard and smart you work.

Follow the following steps to become machine learning expert.

1.Programming skills : Currently R programming and python programming are most used environments for programming in machine learning worldwide. So first of all get some basics and syntax in environment in which you want to do programming. As you are novice learner I will suggest you to go with python programming as it's easy programming language to learn rather than other languages. But both tools overcome each other in different domains. If you have some programming knowledge and you want to start with R programming then I will suggest you to download R studio and practice Swirl packages, it will help you to go through the basics and all syntax in R programming. You may refer following links:

 * Python 3.4 Programming Tutorials - YouTube [ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_ ]
 * swirl | Students [ http://swirlstats.com/students.html ]
2.Learning statistics: Machine learning is nothing but developing different statistical models for given datasets. So you should have better understanding of statistics. I will suggest you the book Introduction to statistical learning which explains all statistical concepts very well. In addition to this there are machine learning algorithms also explained with practical sessions using R programming. They used different datasets to execute different algorithms. Once you go through this book you done with 50% of work in machine learning.PDF of book available here: Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R - Usc - PDF Drive [ https://www.pdfdrive.net/introduction-to-statistical-learning-with-applications-in-r-usc-e8788524.html ]

3. Machine learning algorithms: Once you done with above take online course from Coursera: Machine Learning | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] .

If it's not possible for you to get online course you can find out video tutorials available on YouTube with same name and by same instructor. Instructor of this course is data scientist and he is one of the founders of Coursera MOOC. Here he explained all the concepts and machine learning algorithms very well with real time datasets in practicals. After this course you may done with machine learning. But the most important part starts now that is practicing over different datasets with different algorithms.

4.Implementation of algorithms: I think now you are capable to handle real time datasets. You may get lot of competitions and different real time datasets here: https://www.kaggle.com. Kaggle is home of data science and machine learning. You may learn, work and play with data here. It will make you stronger and you may get challenging problem over there. When you go through different problems apply different algorithms and come up with something better which may lead you to some research papers are transactions. This will definately help you to get a job in this field.

5.Stay connected over LinkedIn: Once you did all above things, your linkedIn profile will become too strong to fight any other apsirants preparing for job in this field. Lot of companies and HRs also looking for good profile over linkedIn so you may get noticed by them. This will give you opportunity to get start your carrier.

This is how you can get job in machine learning field. But question regarding 9 months, it's totally depends on your hard work and intelligence. But one thing is clear that if you will follow above procedure, you will definately become machine learning expert.

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"In my opinion, these are some of the necessary skills:

UPDATE: I create a repo on github of hundreds of software links that should help get you started: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning

1. Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5])

2. Probability and Statistics: A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.

3. Applied Math + Algorithms: For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16].

4. Distributed Computing: Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21].

5. Expertise in Unix Tools: Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1].

6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects: HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale.

7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques: feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though.

Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.

Good luck.

How much time does it take to become a machine learning engineer?,"That will depend on the individuals knowledge and skill.

If you happen to be a Python programmer with really solid SQL skill then you’ll learning curve is going to be short. Why? Because what most of us do all day is work with SQL and Python.

If you know nothing about this space or data then you’re looking at 5–6 years before you’re doing entry level machine learning in the real-world.

Look at this job posting below. That first requirement took me years to learn and become comfortable working with in the real-world. I know people on Quora find SQL easy, that is… until the interview… where the failure rate is around 90%.

That’s just one bullet point!!

Real-world machine learning is not modeling, it’s data cleansing. If you can’t source and clean your own data then you won’t be working in the real-world.

Around 80% of all applied machine learning is data cleansing. I didn’t make this up, this comes from studies and surveys from those in the real-world.

There’s a reason why the salaries and packages are big in this space, it’s because the knowledge, skills and experience are big.

There is no easy path and most will need to start working in a lesser role, like a data analyst or business analyst in order to make the jump to machine learning.

Now, this shouldn’t discourage you. It should help you set some realistic expectations of what’s really required to work in this space. When you’re ready to dig in and learn this platform will get you there [ https://www.logikbot.com/ ]. It’s not an easy path and most simply won’t make it.

How do I choose between becoming a machine learning engineer and a machine learning researcher?,"One useful heuristic in these situations is regret minimization. Think about the (likely) downsides of both choices.

1.) ML Engineer: You end up working on data sets that are useful to some business audience but not algorithmically challenging. You spend a lot of time explaining ML to people who have trouble figuring out the tip at restaurants. You have to keep learning the newest frameworks (Theano! No, Torch! No, Tensorflow! No, Pytorch!) but don’t feel a sense of mastery in any of them. You keep wondering if you should slide sideways into pure software engineering or entrepreneurship, the people you mostly rub shoulders with. Most of your work ends up being glorified feature engineering and even your good outcomes are underappreciated by the customers, internal and external, that you work with.

2.) ML Researcher: You end up one tiny cog in a giant ocean of talent all going into the same field at the same time. You worry that your lab doesn’t have the resources and geniuses within Google DeepMind or Facebook’s AI lab and that anything you create will get embraced-and-extended by their legions of top scientists. No one you know cares about what you do. You start with a good salary but are completely trapped — you’re not qualified for any other job — and the incoming competition is brutal, putting a ceiling on your earning potential. In the end, your contributions are workmanlike but have zero impact on the world.

Which of these scenarios sucks least to you?",https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-Machine-Learning-engineer-and-get-a-job-soon?top_ans=34970287,2017-01-20T18:41:47.568610+00:00,,30,Anonymous,
How can I get a job at Google as a machine learning/AI developer?,"Be good at what you do, and people will start taking notice. I've often come across questions where people tend to gravitate more towards seeking job opportunities at prestigious companies, research institutes or Universities. According to me (and it's a completely personal opinion), the motivation to study machine learning, deep leaning or any other other field just for the sake of getting a good job at google or Microsoft is not enough rather you should aim at becoming so good at your respective domain that people at these giant companies start taking notice, and the only way to do this is to enjoy what you do.

1. The moment you enjoy machine learning, you will start exploring all the sub domains within it.
2. You will start reading the latest papers appearing in archive.
3. You will start contributing to the various open source libraries like pytorch, keras etc.
4. You will start reading blogs by machine learning giants like @Andrej Karpathy , @Chris Olah and various other ML enthusiasts on platforms like Medium – Read, write and share stories that matter [ http://medium.com ] or distil.pub
5. You will start taking part in various data science completions hosted in Your Home for Data Science [ http://kaggle.com ] .
6. You will eventually start writing your own blogs, explaining the various intricacies involved in different ML algorithms for the benefit of your readers.
The point is, when you start doing the above mentioned things, you will develop a passion for ML. Getting a job at Google or Microsoft will be secondary to you. You will start exploring the horizons of ML and DL because you really want to learn and not for the purpose of securing a job.

When this happens your profile at LinkedIn will speak tonnes about your work and it will surely fall in the eyes of recruiters from these tech giants. It will be they who will contact you not the other way round. At the end of the day you will undoubtedly have multiple offers at your hands and it will be you who will negotiate your salary with them.

So my advice to you is sharpen your skills, clear your concepts, start to fall in love with statistics and probability, always lookout for ways to contribute in open source projects. Make github your facebook. Follow people who contribute a lot in the domain of ML and DL, observe the way they code, learn from them.

I am a mechanical engineering student. How can I learn machine learning? Where should I get started?,"Well, I am a Mechanical Engineer and I can assure the course on Coursera for Machine learning is a good start for mechanical engineers. There is nothing like you need a degree in CS or programming to understand it.

Prerequisites for the course: Basics in statistics, basics in linear algebra, and you should know basics of MATLAB or similar programs.

The course is rather theoritical and requires you to have a good mathematics approach rather than a programming expert. Infact you need not have any knowledge of any programming language to start with machine learning. I started learning Python after this course and I had no knowledge of any language before the course. This will be a mechanical engineer’s approach.

If you look at the scope, well, autonomous cars are the future! It will be a perfect blend of how software can control dynamic machines on road, which are mechanically run today.

How can I get my first job in machine learning?,"Build a deep portfolio.

Most people think that portfolios should contain lots and lots of examples. That might work for designers but for people in a technical domain deep is better than wide. Just think of whitepapers and case studies - in depth explanations of what a consultancy did for a client.

If you’re seriously looking for a machine learning job I suggest that you find a data source related to the industry you’d like to work in (healthcare, sports, etc.) and go as deep as you can into the problems of that field.

Start by building simple models, work out why they work and why they don’t. Record what you do (I mean that literally and figuratively, use screen capture software to make videos and write about your process).

Then once you’ve understood the limitations of the simple models make more complex ones. Rinse and repeat.

Eventually you’ll have a really good understanding of the industry, the data sources, and which methods work in which cases. That beats a certification earned by building a dog breeds classifier every time.

Businesses might want people who are experts in machine learning, but they need people who are experts in applying machine learning to their industry.

 * This platform, however, lacks domain-specific courses.
 * Udacity is a fantastic platform for learning Machine Learning from a variety of courses taught by some of the best professors from Stanford University and other universities.
 * The platform also offers some certification courses that help you determine your ranking.
 * However, this platform lacks a good curriculum for advanced ML courses.
 * Simplilearn is a fantastic tool for learning DS/ML.
 * Simplilearn has had a staff of expert teachers for years, training people who want to work in this industry.
 * They offer a mock interview platform called Simplilearn Expert Live to help you prepare for interviews, as well as a library of instructional videos on topics such as machine learning and statistics.
 * This platform, however, has the disadvantage of not offering domain-specific training.
 * It is another one-of-a-kind website that provides the best machine learning and data science courses in Bangalore.
 * The best advantage is that it provides domain specialty courses.
 * Except for this platform, none of the aforementioned platforms provide domain-specific courses.
 * As a result, I would recommend enrolling in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program for working professionals seeking an AI/ML certification with domain electives.
AI/ML will be easier to understand and apply if you use an online platform.

Consider why domain specialization is so important:

Nowadays, to advance in your career, you must first qualify for a specific domain. Specialization in a specific topic is also, in my opinion, the most effective way to advance your career. This type of training allows you to advance in your career while learning about a specific topic. Employers in high-profile professions are looking for domain specialists who have a strong focus on a specific domain.

The following are some of the most important AI/ML course features:

 * Specialization in a Domain:
Another unique feature provided to students through the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program is the domain elective, which is the best option for people who want to learn data science in a specific industry. It offers electives in a variety of fields, including marketing, sales, oil and gas, human resources, banking and financial services, and others.

 * Projects:
Projects in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program are suitable for both beginners and experts. The course culminates in a capstone project that requires you to complete large-scale machine learning and artificial intelligence projects using Python and other data science technologies.

These courses include the following projects:

 * 
 * A self-driving car is capable of driving itself.
 * An emotion detector is included in IBM Analytics for Human Resources, and
 * artificial intelligence is utilized to recognize faces in real-time.

 * Certification:
All of the courses have been approved by the IBM Group. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program award three certificates to students who excel in Machine Learning. IBM certifications are given for completing a course, project, or micro-skills.

 * Hybrid Learning and Project Innovation Labs
It offers hybrid learning options for students who want to apply their knowledge in real-world projects, and they can also access project innovation laboratories located across seven locations nationwide, including Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, and in Bangalore, where they can work on tasks under the guidance of MAANG personnel.

Final Note:

AI/ML is one of the world's fastest-growing industries. It has the potential to change our lives and solve many of the world's problems. It can help with disease treatment and the discovery of new resources that will aid in the preservation of our planet. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is incapable of functioning independently. My goal is for you to be able to weigh all of the pros and cons and make an informed decision. Keep your career in mind when making a decision that could have a significant impact on your future.

"As a data scientist, how can I transition to be a machine learning engineer?","If you are a Data Scientist already, then I am going to assume that you already have the ability to produce at least simple machine learning models. The only other dimension you need to add to your skillset is software engineering. Machine Learning Engineers are just software engineers who focus on ML systems rather than full-stack development, mobile app development, etc. So pickup some projects (or courses) that involve building software, maintaining it, and supporting it. This will typically involve proficiency in a version control system (e.g., git), working with various data sources, deployment of ML systems into production, and scaling to meet demand. Technologies that you may or may not need to be proficient in:

 * git
 * Linux command line utilities
 * SQL database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.
 * NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, etc.
 * Big Data (if your task requires it): Hadoop ecosystem, mapreduce, Spark, etc.
 * Deployment: Docker, ansible, capistrano, etc.
I have not mentioned the various ML libs since you are most likely already familiar with these. I would also recommend looking at available Machine Learning jobs and reviewing the qualifications that they want as some areas tend to have a different focus than others.

I am a mechanical engineering student. How can I learn machine learning? Where should I get started?,"To get started with machine learning, your basics should be sound in at least the following subjects

1. Probability and Statistics
2. Calculus
3. Linear Algebra
In addition, you should be fluent in programming in at least one language. Languages like C, C++ as well as scripting languages like Python, Matlab, R are popularly used to code machine learning algorithms.

If your university has a computer science or some other department that offers a course in machine learning or related areas like data mining, artificial intelligence, then you should try to credit those courses or at least attend lectures. Crediting helps keeping motivation levels high. Make sure to pay attention to the course project if there is one. You may learn much more from working on the project than from the lectures.

In addition, there are a number of online resources (course notes, online courses) for machine learning courses that you can use to learn about the subject. In fact there are Quora questions that explicitly point to some good courses out there. However, you will have to keep your self motivated so that you do not lose focus and leave midway. There are plenty of challenge problems on platforms like Kaggle that you can use as a proxy for a project in this area.

How can I get a job as an ML engineer without any degree?,"The purpose of “a degree” (the actual degree itself - the document/status) is to certify to potential employers that you have had a particular kind of training and have acquired a particular kind of knowledge. Some employers will be sticklers about “actual degrees” - it will just be how they’ve chosen to do business. But some only care about what you know and can do, and not about how it’s documented. First you have to find one of those employers. Then you have to find a way to demonstrate your knowledge to them. Perhaps you pursue your own independent work in this area and create a portfolio of DiY projects that you could show to them. Perhaps you talk them into interviewing you and subjecting you to in-depth technical questions. Perhaps you write a “white paper” or something on the topic that demonstrates your knowledge.

All of these techniques are “informal” ways of demonstrating that you have knowledge. Finding a job this way has gotten harder to do these days, because of how litigious our society has become. Say you get such a job and you make an error in your work that leads to a bad outcome - members of the public dead or inflicted with lifetime injuries. If you have a degree from a prestigious university, then that allows the employer to show that employing you was a “safe risk.” The fact that you were not a degree holder and got hired anyway might be used against them in court - in many cases their lawyers will tell them not to take this chance.

But, you know, I’m on your side and I hope you are able to succeed in this. It feels like how the world “really ought to be” to me - it should be us and our skills and knowledge that matter - not some piece of paper we’ve picked up from someone. Degrees don’t create great products - great engineers do.

Good luck!

How can I get a job as an ML engineer without any degree?,"Before you can start getting a job in machine learning it will be necessary for you to learn how to make use of machine learning.

There are a lot of skills that machine learning makes use of and many of them will be tested in coding challenges for the interviews.

To do well in most machine learning roles it will be necessary for you to have knowledge of calculus, statistics, linear algebra, SQL, programming, data structures and algorithms and of the different machine learning models.

There are two courses that I would recommend that you use to learn machine learning. The first is Andrew Ng’s course [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] which doesn’t assume any prerequisite knowledge. The second is machine learning with Python by MIT [ https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to-deep-learning ] that has prerequisites of probability, linear algebra and programming in Python.

If you need to learn calculus then I would recommend this course [ https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1a-differentiation ] on Edx.

If you need to learn linear algebra then I would recommend this course [ https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers-0 ] on Edx.

If you need to learn probability then I would recommend this course [ https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data-0 ] on Edx.

It is common that you will be tested on SQL, data structures and algorithms in data science and other machine learning type interviews. So, it will be necessary for you to have a good knowledge of them and to practice them a lot on websites such as Leetcode [ http://leetcode.com/ ].

It will be necessary for you to make up for the lack of a degree by showing that you have a lot of experience in machine learning.

One way to get experience in machine learning is to participate in machine learning competitions.

One place that you can find a number of different machine learning competitions on is the Kaggle [ http://kaggle.com/ ] website. On Kaggle there are regularly ranked machine learning competitions that have prize money. If you can do well on one of these competitions you could include it as a part of your resume and it will help to show that you have a good understanding of machine learning.

With that being said, the actual process of applying the machine learning models only makes up a small part of what most machine learning jobs involve. The datasets, that you will find on these competitions, will normally be clean datasets where you will not need to do much data cleaning yourself. In a job setting you’ll likely be spending more time data cleaning than actually selecting and applying the different machine learning models.

So, it is important not to get too focused on Kaggle competitions and to make sure that you have some projects in your portfolio that show that you can clean data.

One way to show that you are able to clean the data would be to build your own machine learning projects.

When making your own machine learning projects it is important to show that you have a good grasp of the whole model building workflow which includes:

 * Importing the data
 * Cleaning the data
 * Pre-processing the data
 * Doing feature transformations (creating new features using existing features)
 * Feature engineering
When making your own machine learning project be sure to include the above steps. The project shouldn’t be too small either but it also doesn’t need to be too large. I would say that the ideal project to put into your portfolio would take about a month to complete. You can look at this blog post  [ https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners ]to see some examples of machine learning projects that you could make.

Once you have completed your machine learning projects be sure to post them on Github and to include a Read Me and other documentation about what you used such as the technology you used, tutorials you referenced and dependencies that you used.

Contributing to open source projects is another good way that you can show that you have experience in machine learning.

By contributing to open source projects you will be able to show that you are able to work as a part of a team on a large project. You will also be able to get a lot of feedback on your code from very knowledgable people on the topic which will greatly help you to improve as a programmer.

Here [ https://about.gitlab.com/2018/04/06/contribute-to-open-source-land-jobs/ ] is a good article that talks about the benefits of using open source projects to land a job in more detail.

MyBridge [ https://github.com/Mybridge/amazing-machine-learning-opensource-2019 ] shows you all of the current opensource projects, on GitHub, that you can contribute to. If you are thinking of contributing to open source projects then I would highly recommend that you take a look at it.",https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-find-a-job-as-a-Machine-Learning-engineer-without-prior-experience-If-so-what-steps-can-be-taken-to-secure-such-a-job?top_ans=345853291,2022-03-23T13:24:04.848228+00:00,,8,Adetunji Saheed,https://www.quora.com/profile/Adetunji-Saheed-1

Can I learn and get a job in Machine Learning without studying CS Master and PhD?,"You can, but it is far more difficult than when I got into the field. Until the depression in the 2000s, having a degree at all was a plus if it was considered at all with most employers. Few cared if you had a degree at all much less what it was in. 

Today it is difficult getting a decent IT job without at least a 4 year degree. Not impossible. Machine learning is one of those advanced jobs, entry level people are not even given the time of day typically. If you don't have 10 years industry experience as a developer, your probably not even going to get your resume looked at. BUT there are ways around that and ways to get industry experience without working for anybody. 

First, no degree program is going to teach you ANY programming language. The course are far to short to do anything but give you the barest introduction. Usually they are taught by people who've never worked in the industry or at least with that language. They often teach very bad habits as short cuts. As a project lead or project manager I dreaded being handed fresh graduates. I spent more time unteaching them very bad habits they learned than I did teaching them how to program. I spent far more time teaching them than they spent writing useful code and I or one of my crew usually had to rewrite everything they wrote until they'd been at it for at least six months. 

You learn how to code by coding. There is no substitute. No short cut. No course that can teach you anything but how to get started. You want to learn how to code. First decide to write something. Pick modest goals at first. You'll be amazed how difficult they can be. Then use the languages you plan to learn to accomplish those goals. Even if they are as simple as a too do list, you'll learn a ton by actually doing it. Even if your first programs are going to be inferior to existing programs. Then write more advance programs. Once you master that stage, write software for somebody else. ANYBODY else. They'll force you to learn a ton, as they'll ask for things which will stretch your skills. 

Next get involved in OSS projects. Learn from the code you interact with and you'll gain practical industry experience writing the code. It's even better if you apply to a company that uses code you wrote. You can point to an app and say I am part of that project. Goes a long way to winning a job. Especially when you have no paid industry experience. 

Then as you master programming in the languages you'll be using, THEN tackle machine learning, AI and intelligent assistants. You'll want to learn Smalltalk, CLIPS, LISP, C++ and Python,  Java is another that can be invaluable, knowing PHP, Xcode, Ruby, PERL, and .NET are going to be a really good idea. Don't worry, once you know one language, it's a whole lot easier learning others, the exceptions being Java and LISP.  Today being a programmer and not knowing SQL is like driving a car and not knowing how to change a tire. NoSQL is gaining traction out there as well and it'd be wise to learn it. R programming is also something your going to learn whether you like it or not. 

While you are learning that, start with Donald Hebbs work. It is really the foundation of all AI and machine learning. The Psychology jargon might be a little daunting, but you can muddle through that for the foundations of neural nets and machine learning. Piaget is another Psychologist which you'll want to at least learn the basics of their work. 

Then get involved in OSS machine learning projects. Get your industry experience there. OSS projects are always desperate for developers. 

Finally you can get an industry job doing it. 

As an alternate, learn how to write machine learning on your own. Then develop your own OSS project or commercial piece of software to solve a problem and make your own doorway into the industry.

"If there are no entry level positions for a machine learning engineer, how can a beginner secure a job without experience in this field?","Let’s put some definitions to your question. “Beginner” should have some background in ML and solid engineering/infrastructure understanding. The only thing “beginners” lack is hands-on working experience. Otherwise, you should start acquiring the relevant skills and meet the min requirement.

For this type of beginner, you can learn the basic entry level knowledge without a real working experience. I was in the same boat as you a few years back, and here are my favorite approaches to quickly build up my domain knowledge:

1. Read companies engineering blogs.
Tech companies put in the best effort into their engineering blogs as a recruiting platform. New ML engineers and all other tech workers can learn a ton from reading these blog posts.

Try to understand the business scenario, the chosen tech stack/solutions, the implementation, the tradeoffs, etc.

I’ve been reading widely and learn a ton of in-depth knowledge of how different tech companies approach the same problems. It’s eye-opening and rewarding.

1. Write something.
Reading is the input, and writing is the output. After reading and learning all the best practices from the blog posts, why don’t you compile all the learnings and summarize the takeaways. Moreover, you can come up with new ideas and elaborate on why your solutions are better than others.

1. Network
Reaching out to industry insiders and network with them. Try to learn their day-to-day work, challenges, and solutions. I’ve been doing this for years. Networking can be uncomfortable at first but useful in the long run.

Wish you best luck!",https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-find-a-job-as-a-Machine-Learning-engineer-without-prior-experience-If-so-what-steps-can-be-taken-to-secure-such-a-job?top_ans=1477743707158858,2023-11-05T05:09:22.226055+00:00,,0,"Leihua Ye, PhD",https://www.quora.com/profile/Leihua-Ye-PhD
Is it possible to get a job in Machine Learning with no work experience?,"I think you'd do well to follow my path, which is quite unusual.

As much as a young field of Machine Learning (ML) can say that it has a “tradition”, I took a very non-traditional approach. I didn't even know I was doing ML!

I think there is an important fact of ML that is poorly understood. There are three legs to the ML Stool:

1. ML algorithms, such as Neural Networks (NN) Boosted Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Generalized Linear Model, etc. This area gets all the hype and attention. Almost everyone approaches ML from this Top-Down path.
2. Training Sets (TS) are the life blood of ML. Any model will have short comings if the TS has bad labels, incomplete coverage, etc. Nothing and nobody can learn from nothing!
3. Features are what can be extracted from TS. I had been worried that NN could learn all the facets of an example from the TS. It certainly is true for Computer Vision (CV) or speech recognition (SE). But what I've come to realize, it's “expensive” for NN to learn this way: it needs a large TS and it takes a long time to train. For CV and SR, there's nothing better. But for other problems, having deep insight into making Features can be quite powerful.
ML works by taking TS and its features as input to an ML algorithm that buida the model. If any of the three legs comes up short, the model will come up short too.

I made my career from working the other two legs, which is more of a bottom up approach. The trick is I became a Domain Expert at the data, in both building highly curated training sets as well as writing code to extract features. When these three legs are combined together, a powerful ML model can be built.

I find my intuition and soft, non-programming skills allows me to create features and flesh out training sets. I've had a few successes as a result.

Part of it, is I know more statistics than the average programmer and maybe I know more programming than the average statistician.

My role is quite complementary (and in support) to the “traditional” ML Engineer. The hard part is getting people to see my value-add as most people don't worry about the other two legs as much as they should.

So, yes it's possible to get a job in ML but it might not be easy.",https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-find-a-job-as-a-Machine-Learning-engineer-without-prior-experience-If-so-what-steps-can-be-taken-to-secure-such-a-job?top_ans=39680100,2017-03-21T02:17:09.985642+00:00,,11,Clem Wang,https://www.quora.com/profile/Clem-Wang-1
Can I learn and get a job in Machine Learning without studying CS Master and PhD?,"The answer is both ‘YES’ and ‘NO’.

‘NO’ if you don’t understand the mathematics and the logic behind Machine Learning.

Source:Google

In today’s world, more than your degree, “SKILLS“ matter. You may or may not have a Master or PhD in CS yet you can become a ML expert. The condition is you’re good in Mathematics and Statistics. In this era of free MOOCs upgrading yourself is not difficult. You can have a Bachelors in Economics/Mathematics/Statistics or even Literature but you have to be quite good with basic mathematics to get a good grasp of ML models. There are several courses in Coursera, Analytics Vidhya, Edureka, DataQuest, KDNuggets, GeeksforGeeks which one can use to learn.

Participate in hackathons and competitions in Kaggle. Make mistakes and learn from it. That is the best way to teach yourself any skill in any domain.

It’s better to do Masters in AI and DataScience than just CS if the career to be pursued is in Machine Learning.

Prerequisites of a ML expert - Knowledge in Python/R, Good knowledge in SQL, Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra, Probability, Stochastic Calculus, Inferential Statistics. If it’s more niche role, Graph theory or Discreet mathematics will also be required above them.

Mostly employers prefer candidates with bachelors who know how to work using built-in ML models without writing complex formulas or equations. But in certain companies where problems require algorithms to be tweaked or even built from scratch - a MSc/PhD will be of more importance.",https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-find-a-job-as-a-Machine-Learning-engineer-without-prior-experience-If-so-what-steps-can-be-taken-to-secure-such-a-job?top_ans=292039108,2021-06-27T19:04:41.224400+00:00,2021-06-27T19:14:59.230473+00:00,44,Priyanka Banerjee,https://www.quora.com/profile/Priyanka-Banerjee-48
How much time does it take to become a machine learning engineer?,"That will depend on the individuals knowledge and skill.

If you happen to be a Python programmer with really solid SQL skill then you’ll learning curve is going to be short. Why? Because what most of us do all day is work with SQL and Python.

If you know nothing about this space or data then you’re looking at 5–6 years before you’re doing entry level machine learning in the real-world.

Look at this job posting below. That first requirement took me years to learn and become comfortable working with in the real-world. I know people on Quora find SQL easy, that is… until the interview… where the failure rate is around 90%.

That’s just one bullet point!!

Real-world machine learning is not modeling, it’s data cleansing. If you can’t source and clean your own data then you won’t be working in the real-world.

Around 80% of all applied machine learning is data cleansing. I didn’t make this up, this comes from studies and surveys from those in the real-world.

There’s a reason why the salaries and packages are big in this space, it’s because the knowledge, skills and experience are big.

There is no easy path and most will need to start working in a lesser role, like a data analyst or business analyst in order to make the jump to machine learning.

Now, this shouldn’t discourage you. It should help you set some realistic expectations of what’s really required to work in this space. When you’re ready to dig in and learn this platform will get you there [ https://www.logikbot.com/ ]. It’s not an easy path and most simply won’t make it.

Can I get a machine learning job without experience? How do I learn ML and get hands-on?,"Yes, the Machine Learning domain is open to freshers as well as experienced engineers. The global Machine Learning market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 42.8% from 2018 to 2024. As an ML expert, you will be required to develop intelligent algorithms to find patterns in massive datasets, train systems based on those patterns, and predict future outcomes. You will also have to visualize the obtained data, analyze different ML techniques, and deploy the solution to real-world problems.

Here’s how to get started with ML:

1. Take up a certification course:

There are many online certification courses and degrees offered by accredited institutes all over India in Machine Learning. For instance, the Executive PG Program in Machine Learning & AI by IIIT Bangalore in collaboration with upGrad is a 12-month long online certification program covering in-demand skills like Deep Learning, NLP, Cloud computing, and programming under the mentorship of industry experts from Flipkart, Zee5, Actify, and Gramener. The programming languages, libraries, and tools it covers are Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Seaborn, Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services, TensorFlow, and MySQL. Moreover, to prepare the student in hands-on experience, this curriculum includes case studies like:

 * Model training to play tic-tac-toe
 * Fraud detection in banking systems
 * Building a chatbot for making reservations
 * Detecting skin cancer from images
 * Speech recognition
 * Data visualization using regression techniques
 * Recommendation system for advertising
 * Telecom churn analysis
It offers more than 450 hours of video content, 30 case studies and assignments, 10 hands-on industry-based capstone projects, and live coding classes with 1-to-1 feedback sessions with the experts. With such a course in hand, you will learn thoroughly the theoretical concepts and how to apply them to solve real-world problems.

2. Practice programming in any one language:

Machine Learning professionals know coding in several programming languages but are proficient in any one. The top ten ML languages with their associated libraries to practice and develop are:

 * Python – ScikitLearn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
 * Java – Apache Commons, Google Guava, Jackson, JAXB
 * C++ – Cinder, OpenCV, FloatX, Wt
 * R – Dplyr, ggplot2, MLR, Lubridate
 * JavaScript – Leaflet, anime.js, Moment.js, Masonry
3. Choose one skill and master it:

Like programming languages, certain other marketable ML skills require dedicated study and practice through projects. Some of them are:

 * Neural Networks
 * Cloud Computing
 * Natural Language Processing
 * Artificial Intelligence
 * Computer Vision
Machine Learning job salaries depend a lot upon the skill set that the engineer has developed. For example, a Python expert may earn an average annual salary of INR 6.12 lacs, while an expert in Computer Vision may earn an average yearly package of INR 7.63 lacs. Invest in such a high-demand skill that also aligns with your field of interest.

Once you get a grip over the theory part of the subject, start building your own code, model, and project based on your skillset on platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle, and OpenML to gain hands-on experience in developing solutions.

Conclusion

Machine Learning salaries can reach up to INR 1.7 crores a year for highly experienced professionals. Industries like transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, finance, digital marketing, and education already heavily depend upon AI algorithms and ML-based automation, making machine Learning a highly recommended domain to pursue a career in.",https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-find-a-job-as-a-Machine-Learning-engineer-without-prior-experience-If-so-what-steps-can-be-taken-to-secure-such-a-job?top_ans=292168717,2021-06-28T10:49:07.352487+00:00,,7,Sriram K,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sriram-K-172

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"In my opinion, these are some of the necessary skills:

UPDATE: I create a repo on github of hundreds of software links that should help get you started: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning

1. Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5])

2. Probability and Statistics: A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.

3. Applied Math + Algorithms: For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16].

4. Distributed Computing: Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21].

5. Expertise in Unix Tools: Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1].

6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects: HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale.

7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques: feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though.

Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.

Good luck.

Most companies use a bachelors in something as a filter.

All you need is a bachelors though.

The good news is, machine learning engineers are made in the real-world, not from academia.

Don’t listen to anyone who tells you about the math and advanced degree you need. That’s utter horseshit.

Can I learn and get a job in Machine Learning without studying CS Master and PhD?,"In this age, where schools and books are being made obsolete by MOOCs and programming websites (at least in the field of Computer Science), yes you can, and you should. 

 Let's take 'Machine Learning Engineer' as a running example. In their daily role, they build/test/deploy machine learning systems that can classify/analyse hundreds of data. They are not expected to take state-of-the-art methods further, they only need to be aware of the tools to use for their specific purpose.

I think a good combination of programming skills, coupled with a good machine learning foundation (being aware of classification and clustering algorithms, being able to understand mathematical formulas and tricks stated in the papers) is enough for that role, as a beginner. 

You will see an image below, an open position at Palantir [3], a machine learning and data analysis giant based in USA. The formal position is here: Software Engineer (Machine Learning) [ https://www.palantir.com/careers/positions/software-engineer-machine-learning/ ]

Figure.1 A machine learning engineer job requirements and desirable skills at Palantir[3]

What do they want? They require BS in CS, communication skills to understand customer needs, data cleaning and processing skills and strong programming  (C/C++) and scripting (Python, R) background. 

You need to understand base algorithms on machine learning. You may check Andrew NG's excellent machine learning course [2] from Coursera for this. Weekly assignments held in Matlab will enable you to do hands-on experience with a scripting language while understanding the algorithms. I strongly suggest you to read excellent  ""A few useful things to know about machine learning"" from Pedro Domingos [1]. 

You should be aware of available machine learning libraries which will fuel your work when it comes to implementation [6]

Then, you can go further and set-up a distributed computing platform (Hadoop, Spark, etc) in your own desktop [4]. As you probably do not have so many clusters to distribute work across, you can work on a virtual machine version of Spark. Then, you may try to implement the same algorithms told in the machine learning course using Python, in a distributed or single machine setting. This will allow you to think in terms of 'scalability' of algorithms, which is one of the important skills as an engineer. You may use a scalable algorithm or find a way to distribute workload to clusters. 

You can even go further and join Kaggle [5] competitions which is an excellent place to compete with people for different real-world problems. 

What you have done so far? You understood the basics of machine learning algorithms, you implemented them using scripting languages, you experience distributed computing platforms, and you even compete with real people on real-world data problems. OK, a masters will not hurt your chance for doing all of these, but who really need this in today's world? 

Good Luck.

Is it possible to secure jobs only on the basis of machine learning expertise without being a proper software engineer?,"ATA I assume you are looking at roles in software companies that involve machine learning, so-called ""data scientist"" roles. The work is still 80% engineering. 

There is so much demand that, yes, you can find a job. I think you will find it difficult to be effective though. However, you do have some proper engineering skills in Python and R, and this is much better than only having written papers. 

I think you should focus on related engineering skills to complement what you know already. For instance, if you land in a software startup and are asked to build a model based on click logs, how will you get them? If they're in a database, would you know how to access them? what about HBase, as JSON events? what if they're Apache web server logs?

"I want to make my career in machine learning. How do I start? What should I learn, and where?","I work in Data Science / Machine Learning based software products team. My team comprises of Machine Learning engineers, Data Scientists and Data Engineers.

People have made switch from QA to Data Engineer. Developer to Data Scientist. I have given almost 2 years in understanding Machine learning / Data science.

Here’s my take

as Mike West [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-West-99 ] mentioned there’s no easy way. Below are some Dos and Don’ts

1. If you are starting from scratch work on basics first.
2. 
1. Statistics.(Descriptive and Inferential ) Khan academy has amazing videos
2. Probability. Again Khan academy
3. Matrix operations and manipulation
4. Basic Linear Algebra. It will help you visualize things in 3D plane.

3. A programming language. Python is your best bet. Learn various data manipulation and statistical libraries.
4. Learn SQL . Most of your time as ML/ DS person will be spend in querying the data source.
5. Start with some basic algorithms Linear Regression and understand end to end.
6. Get some publicly available data and play with that. Understand the data. Try to see patterns. Apply visualizations for better understanding.
7. Then eventually learn more complex Algorithms.
8. Look at kaggle at other persons solutions to learn more. But frankly dont take it too seriously as real life problems are way more abstract than Kaggle problems. Use kaggle to build your portfolio.
9. Refer some good books.
10. 
1. Introduction to Statistical Learning  [ http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ ]: Excellent book to start with.
2. Buy Pandas for Everyone: Python Data Analysis, 1e Book Online at Low Prices in India [ https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/9352869168/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ]
3. Buy Machine Learning Book Online at Low Prices in India [ https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1259096955/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ]
4. Deep Learning classics like Deep Learning [ https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ ]

11. Eventually read ML papers and try to implement them.
12. If possible get a full time degree. With so many people doing 1 week to 6 months online course , it will be very difficult for you to separate yourself from the crowd.
Dont’s :

1. Don’t fall for boot camps which promises to make you ML engineer in 6 months or 3 months. if its that easy then why companies pay you higher salaries. There’s no magic bullet.
2. Don’t get overwhelmed by so much information available. Start small and basic. Keep on increasing complexity
3. Don’t rush to implement algorithms to data set. Understand each properly, their use case .
4. Try to avoid costly online courses.
Below are the courses I did:

1. 1 year PGD in Data Science from IIM Kolkata .(not recommended) (cost almost 3.5 lakh in 2018)
2. couple of MOOC from Udemy. (too shallow)
3. Applied Course [ https://www.appliedaicourse.com/ ] : Excellent course structure. (cost 25k in 2019) . I wish I could have done it as first thing. The certification may not value much but knowledge you will get will be immense.
I hope this helps.

How can I get my first job in machine learning?,"Build a deep portfolio.

Most people think that portfolios should contain lots and lots of examples. That might work for designers but for people in a technical domain deep is better than wide. Just think of whitepapers and case studies - in depth explanations of what a consultancy did for a client.

If you’re seriously looking for a machine learning job I suggest that you find a data source related to the industry you’d like to work in (healthcare, sports, etc.) and go as deep as you can into the problems of that field.

Start by building simple models, work out why they work and why they don’t. Record what you do (I mean that literally and figuratively, use screen capture software to make videos and write about your process).

Then once you’ve understood the limitations of the simple models make more complex ones. Rinse and repeat.

Eventually you’ll have a really good understanding of the industry, the data sources, and which methods work in which cases. That beats a certification earned by building a dog breeds classifier every time.

What's a machine learning career like?,"I hate to see this question get so few answers. I don’t qualify myself as having a career in machine learning as I don’t spend the majority of my time researching algorithms on a theoretical level. I do, however, have a career that involves machine learning in practice, and I’ll describe that for you. As a Data Scientist, I would describe my career as:

 * Fun - Solving problems are just plain fun. I like to think of a data science problem like a Nintendo game: Some parts can be very frustrating and make you want to quit, but if you power through it, you get to enjoy the fun of beating the game.
 * Interesting - Following how a problem is solved from start to finish is very appealing to those interested in STEM fields. The feeling is comparable to eating your favorite chips, once you get one piece of information, you have to have more until you have to tell yourself to stop. And then have another anyway.
 * Exciting - In data science and machine learning in particular, new approaches are being introduced almost every day. This makes you realize how incredible it is to be a part of an era where technology is making advances we couldn’t have fathomed even 10 years ago. This thrill can make you feel as if you are a part of an elite group that has been appointed to change the world. You might not contribute a whole lot, but you know you’re included.
 * Confusing - When researching a topic, it’s more often than not where you come across something that just won’t stick the first time around. While some concepts might take minutes for others to understand, you might scratch your head for two full days before it truly sinks in. But when it does.. You realize why it was worth it. It’s like being young, having a crush send you mixed signals, and then one day they finally tell you they like you.
 * Different - A career in this field can sometimes make you wonder how 9–5 jobs even exist. You think to yourself I’ve spent 4 weeks on this problem and it doesn’t feel like I’ve made any progress. And then you compare it to a summer job you had when you were younger and recall that most jobs have an immediate turn around on value. They work to provide a service. Now I’m working to generate a solution and there is absolutely no standard on how long it might take.
I would say that if any of this sounds intriguing to you then you should hop on the train. Like I said, you don’t have to contribute a whole lot, but simply being a part of it all makes it worth your time.

What's a machine learning career like?,"I started a company that offers ML services along with analytics to institutions. Needless to say, my own myths about how this business would develop have been quickly shattered:

 * Clients generally do not understand what ML is, and conflate it with other terms such as BI, Big Data, AI, and Analytics. With such overlaps to effectively provide a service offering around ML there’s a need to educate your market about it. You will never stop teaching people what it is.
 * About 99% of business problems do not require any kind of deep learning. Most are solvable using the basic trifecta (linear, logistic, clustering) and occasionally some less common stuff (survival, graph, PCA). Introducing some slightly more advanced techniques such as SVM and Random Forests - will be met with skepticism and hesitation, as companies will not be comfortable with blackbox technologies.
 * The few times ML may be needed are the niche use cases that some companies are only now trying to explore - such as object detection, speech to text, and audio sentiment analysis. These are very few in the grand scheme of possible gigs.
 * Whatever the ML you introduce, clients respond to a tangible interface immediately - and sometimes the interface makes or breaks the deal rather than the core ML itself. So having a web-portal, mobile app, chat bot window - these are the things that make clients respond - vs. an advanced algo output presented only on Powerpoint or Excel.
 * The hype around ML and especially AI is massive - so nowadays it may actually be a downer to mention it because you’ll be lumped together with hordes of hobby ML and AI practitioners and worse some pretenders hawking the same services.
On the whole, it’s still a fun place to be - removing the emotion sometimes associated with the hype.

How can I switch career to Machine Learning?,"What skill do you need to learn?

Machine learning.

If you want to skip the rant and go to my actual advice, scroll to the bottom!

Rant

Yes, it’s an obvious advantage that you know some programming. Coding proficiency is a basic requirement to do machine learning, although it’s not as important as in a typical software developer job.

Mathematical optimization and calculus is somewhat important.

Linear algebra and statistics is really important.

Probability and combinatorics is really important.

But these are just prerequisites. Most importantly, machine learning is an entire branch of computer science in itself. There is feature engineering, deep learning, ensembling and all kinds of stuff you need to learn about that are not part of the above-mentioned areas.

If you come from a regular programming background, machine learning will require a shift in perspective. You’re no longer dealing with deterministic logic in the form of ifs and elses. You’re now dealing with probabilities and uncertainties.

In most of software development, the business logic is very simple. In machine learning, business logic is everything.

Object-oriented programming is no longer important. Efficient functions are. For loops and while loops are things to be avoided. Matrix multiplications and vectorized code is your new bread and butter. I’m tempted to say that you will need to throw out everything you have learned about programming and start over. That would be an exagerration, but there is some truth in it.

Advice

With your background, you have a really good foundation for becoming a big data architect. Linux, Python, Java and systems administration is mostly what big data is all about. As a big data developer, you can start experimenting with big data anlytics and gradually progress into machine learning from there.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-best-starting-jobs-to-eventually-enter-a-Machine-Learning-career?top_ans=41155346,2017-04-07T12:14:29.176616+00:00,2017-04-07T12:22:59.287244+00:00,70,Håkon Hapnes Strand,https://www.quora.com/profile/Håkon-Hapnes-Strand
How can I switch career to Machine Learning?,"I like the other answers, but I’m slightly more optimistic.

You mainly need to be really, really passionate about machine learning. You need to be excited enough to learn all the fundamentals. But just like it’s accepted today that web development is a skill that can be learned by those with non-traditional backgrounds, I believe the same is true for machine learning.

There’s quite a bit of academic elitism surrounding machine learning at the moment, and that totally makes sense for machine learning research. Just like it still makes sense for most forms of computer science research. But for applied machine learning? I just don’t buy it. Yes, you absolutely have to understand statistics and probability theory and linear algebra. It is critical that you can properly validate the generalization performance of your models. But I just don’t see why those foundational subjects are out of reach for an autodidact. And I’m posting this now, because I’m willing to stick my neck out that five years from now we will see applied machine learning the way we see software engineering today.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-best-starting-jobs-to-eventually-enter-a-Machine-Learning-career?top_ans=41197192,2017-04-07T22:50:09.909085+00:00,,21,Benjamin,https://www.quora.com/profile/Benjamin-1789
What's a machine learning career like?,"It’s a job.

Please don’t put this career on a pedestal or you’ll need a shit not of Prozac when you get hired. It’s very little modeling and mostly data and meetings.

What’s great about being a machine learning engineer?

I’m not going to lie… the money. If you would have told me in college that someday I’d make 300K a year I would have walked you to counselling services.

In addition to the money, job flexibility is insane. I pick jobs I want. If I don’t like what I hear in the interview I end it and move on.

I like working with smart people. It’s really less draining than working with idiots.

I love learning and in this role, you’ll learn something new everyday I promise.

Now, it’s not all sunshine and lollipops.

Working with real-world data sucks. There’s no two ways about. It’s what I spend most of my time doing. If you have to work with unstructured data then the suckage level increases exponentially.

Can I get a machine learning job without experience? How do I learn ML and get hands-on?,"Yes, the Machine Learning domain is open to freshers as well as experienced engineers. The global Machine Learning market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 42.8% from 2018 to 2024. As an ML expert, you will be required to develop intelligent algorithms to find patterns in massive datasets, train systems based on those patterns, and predict future outcomes. You will also have to visualize the obtained data, analyze different ML techniques, and deploy the solution to real-world problems.

Here’s how to get started with ML:

1. Take up a certification course:

There are many online certification courses and degrees offered by accredited institutes all over India in Machine Learning. For instance, the Executive PG Program in Machine Learning & AI by IIIT Bangalore in collaboration with upGrad is a 12-month long online certification program covering in-demand skills like Deep Learning, NLP, Cloud computing, and programming under the mentorship of industry experts from Flipkart, Zee5, Actify, and Gramener. The programming languages, libraries, and tools it covers are Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Seaborn, Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services, TensorFlow, and MySQL. Moreover, to prepare the student in hands-on experience, this curriculum includes case studies like:

 * Model training to play tic-tac-toe
 * Fraud detection in banking systems
 * Building a chatbot for making reservations
 * Detecting skin cancer from images
 * Speech recognition
 * Data visualization using regression techniques
 * Recommendation system for advertising
 * Telecom churn analysis
It offers more than 450 hours of video content, 30 case studies and assignments, 10 hands-on industry-based capstone projects, and live coding classes with 1-to-1 feedback sessions with the experts. With such a course in hand, you will learn thoroughly the theoretical concepts and how to apply them to solve real-world problems.

2. Practice programming in any one language:

Machine Learning professionals know coding in several programming languages but are proficient in any one. The top ten ML languages with their associated libraries to practice and develop are:

 * Python – ScikitLearn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
 * Java – Apache Commons, Google Guava, Jackson, JAXB
 * C++ – Cinder, OpenCV, FloatX, Wt
 * R – Dplyr, ggplot2, MLR, Lubridate
 * JavaScript – Leaflet, anime.js, Moment.js, Masonry
3. Choose one skill and master it:

Like programming languages, certain other marketable ML skills require dedicated study and practice through projects. Some of them are:

 * Neural Networks
 * Cloud Computing
 * Natural Language Processing
 * Artificial Intelligence
 * Computer Vision
Machine Learning job salaries depend a lot upon the skill set that the engineer has developed. For example, a Python expert may earn an average annual salary of INR 6.12 lacs, while an expert in Computer Vision may earn an average yearly package of INR 7.63 lacs. Invest in such a high-demand skill that also aligns with your field of interest.

Once you get a grip over the theory part of the subject, start building your own code, model, and project based on your skillset on platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle, and OpenML to gain hands-on experience in developing solutions.

Conclusion

Machine Learning salaries can reach up to INR 1.7 crores a year for highly experienced professionals.

"I need to learn data science from scratch, where do I start?","I can tell you that the first step in learning data science is to have a strong foundation in math and statistics. These are the building blocks of data science and will help you understand the concepts of 1. Probability

2. Data modeling

3. Data analysis.

Once you have a good grasp of math and statistics, you can start learning programming languages like Python or R. These languages are widely used in the data science industry and have a lot of resources available online for beginners. You can start with simple coding exercises and gradually move on to more complex data analysis tasks.

When I started learning data science, I had a strong background in math and statistics but was a complete beginner in programming. I decided to enroll in an online course that taught Python for data science. The course was designed for beginners and took me through the basics of Python programming and data analysis. I spent several months practicing and completing the assignments, and by the end of the course, I had a good understanding of Python and was able to analyze data using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

After completing the course, I continued to practice by working on personal data analysis projects and participating in online course like Logicmojo. I also read books and articles on data science and attended online webinars and workshops to keep myself updated on the latest trends and techniques in data science. Thanks to Logicmojo, I am able to switch from software engineer job to data scientist job.

Here are some tips to help you on your journey:

1. Learn the basics of statistics and probability theory. Data science is all about analyzing and interpreting data, so it's important to have a solid foundation in statistical concepts like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and hypothesis testing. You'll also want to understand probability theory, including concepts like Bayes' theorem and the normal distribution.
2. Learn a programming language. Python and R are both popular languages for data science, so it's a good idea to choose one of these and start learning the basics. You'll want to become familiar with data structures, loops, conditional statements, and functions. There are many online resources available to help you learn these languages, including online courses, tutorials, and books.
3. Learn about data visualization. Effective data visualization is essential for communicating your findings to others, so it's important to understand the principles of good data visualization. You'll want to learn how to create charts and graphs that effectively convey your message.
4. Learn about machine learning. Machine learning is a key component of data science, so it's important to understand the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as common algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
5. Practice, practice, practice! Data science is a hands-on field, so it's important to practice working with real-world data sets. There are many online resources available where you can access real-world data sets and practice your data analysis skills.
In conclusion, learning data science from scratch can be a challenging but rewarding journey. With a strong foundation in math and statistics, programming skills, and continuous practice and learning, you can become a skilled data scientist in no time.

Good luck on your journey!",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-best-starting-jobs-to-eventually-enter-a-Machine-Learning-career?top_ans=1477743659688598,2023-04-17T01:35:02.131865+00:00,,248,Tanya Jain,https://www.quora.com/profile/Tanya-Jain-661
"In what order should I learn machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence?","Machine learning is a core topic for all the field listed in the question (DL, NLP, AI). At least for their state-of-the-art methods for 2016.

Let’s take a look at the connections.

TL;DR version:

Machine Learning is the broadest topic that includes Deep Learning and 99% of NLP. You definitely need to get comfortable with it’s main concepts and methods before moving further.

NLP is not really challenging, if you are looking for applications in industry. It comes naturally over the course of ML done right.

Deep Learning can be very mathematically and technically demanding, depends on your actual goal. Implementing algorithms from the latest papers is often hard even using powerful frameworks like TensorFlow. Proceed when prepared.

AI should not be studied before getting significant ML experience. It’s a very, very misleading concept that nobody gets right from the start. I explain this in the long version.

Long version

When you start studying machine learning, you study a lot of core math and programming concepts that will be necessary everywhere along the way. But since the topic is so vast, it can be overwhelming. Another important question is “how do I know that I’m ready to move further?”, because you can go as deep into ML as you want.

If you choose to follow the introductory ML courses, choose the ones with the broadest algorithm curriculum. If you want to read books, get these two:

1. Very tough mathematically heavy book, preferably PRML
2. Very technical book with an emphasis on programming
Why? Often you will feel a certain type of confusion. When you have a question “why?”, get the first book and it will contain the answer, maybe in an obscure form, but you will find it most of the time. When you have a question “how?”, get the second book and write some code.

Transition to Deep Learning can be hard since you will need to read a lot of papers to stay ahead and you can’t always find a convenient implementation of a new architecture. But it all gets easier really quickly once you are familiar with TF, Keras or Theano.

The connection between these two is obvious. Deep Learning is a part of ML. Same principles, same metrics, but far more demanding in terms of hardware and very time-consuming. Also, much more fun. You will need to read a couple of new books, “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Courville, Bengio is the best, use the citations for expanding your knowledge on particular topics.

On Artificial Intelligence

Many people tell you to start studying AI from math, programming or neuroscience. That’s sometimes a solid advice, but if you don’t know anything about it except what you read in media, your path will be far longer than it could be. Massive misunderstandings of what AI actually is, where is it now and how is it developed come from media image and popular posts about it. Sixty six years ago Alan Turing wrote a paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” - start with it. Ask yourself the same questions that he puts there, find the weak spots in his philosophy and move from there. Read about the “golden years of artificial intelligence” - 1956–1974. John McCarthy was a brilliant mind and one of AI pioneers. Read about his results. Your first goal should be acquiring a clear vision of what AI is supposed to be and where is it now. After that - reinforcement learning, acting agents, neural programming, that’s where the real fun begins.

Summary

From practical perspective it’s better to build a broad algorithmic foundation and decide from there whether you want to move into DL or reinforcement learning, whether you want to apply it to computer vision or NLP and so on, since the list you put in the question is a really long commitment.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-best-starting-jobs-to-eventually-enter-a-Machine-Learning-career?top_ans=24151534,2016-06-20T22:23:18.991532+00:00,,369,Roman Trusov,https://www.quora.com/profile/Roman-Trusov
What are the best ways to get started with machine learning?,"When you say “get started”, what do you mean? If you want to make a career of it you need credentials. You are going to need a degree in computer science at a minimum, but even that would not be enough. You probably need a masters degree. Those degree programs would get you “started”. In the end you need to be a fully trained software engineer with knowledge of statistics and data bases. People get paid a lot in machine learning because it is a very difficult thing to do.

If you want to do this as a hobby it doesn’t matter how you start … you will be lost. You can watch a few videos and do a couple of online courses. After that you can tell everyone that you know how to do machine learning.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-best-starting-jobs-to-eventually-enter-a-Machine-Learning-career?top_ans=400260867,2022-11-25T15:13:21.451299+00:00,,0,Joe Porter,https://www.quora.com/profile/Joe-Porter-31
How does a total beginner start to learn machine learning if they have some knowledge of programming languages?,"Awesome questions! Machine learning is a great field to get into; not only is it highly sought after by employers, it also helps you understand the world in a new way.

Most machine learning algorithms are based heavily in math, and are made possible by programming. Here are the basic things I would suggest picking up as you tackle machine learning:

1. Matrix Algebra: Matrix algebra is really important when you start working with large amounts of data; here’s a good online matrix algebra class from MIT: Linear Algebra [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/ ]
2. Statistics: It’s been argued that machine learning is really just computer aided statistics. I’m not sure if I totally agree with that, but having a basis in statistics will help you wrap your head around a lot of the simpler learning algorithms (i.e. regression). I haven’t taken this course specifically, but I’ve heard good things about Udacity’s statistics offering: Elementary Statistics Course Online [ https://www.udacity.com/course/statistics--st095 ]
3. Calculus: I know, now it sounds like I’m just listing off every math class I know—like I said, machine learning is math-heavy. You don’t need that much calculus, but having a basic grasp of what a derivative is will be really helpful. This page is pretty simple, but if you can get through it and fell like you understand what’s going on, you’re in good shape (at least to start): The Definition of the Derivative [ http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/diff/der00/der00.html ]
4. Programming: Of course you’ll have to program in order to actually implement learning algorithms, and it’s good to know a general purpose programming language. You said you have experience with Java and Python and those are great. If you didn’t I would recommend picking up Python through CodeCademy: Python [ https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python ]
5. MatLab: It’s important to know how to program in general, but it’s also really helpful to be familiar with MatLab; you can effectively study machine learning in another language (i.e. Python) but so many of the resources for beginners use MatLab. If you are in college you can probably get MatLab for free through your institution. If not, I would suggest trying out Octave; it’s fairly similar to MatLab, and its free.
6. Basic Learning Algorithms: Finally to the fun stuff. To get a feel for the basics I would strongly suggest you check out Andrew Ng’s Coursera course on machine learning. It’s well made, and very accessible. In it he draws on all the things in this list; although he briefly introduces each of these subjects, it’ll be a lot easier if you have a foundation in all of them before tackling machine learning: Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/ ]
If you can make your way through this list, by the end you should at least be familiar with the field of machine learning, and be prepared to figure out what you want to learn next. Good luck!",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-best-starting-jobs-to-eventually-enter-a-Machine-Learning-career?top_ans=28288622,2016-09-24T14:12:19.336898+00:00,,256,William Lifferth,https://www.quora.com/profile/William-Lifferth
Where do I start if I want to make a career in machine learning?,"A2A.

There are two careers in Machine learning.

 * Researcher kind of roles
 * Practical roles
I am assuming you meant the second one. To this I would suggest you to first take a basic course on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some thing like this Machine Learning | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ].

After this, there are lot of applied machine learning courses online. Try to go through at least two. Since they are taught by different people, I would recommend you to go through more than one course to get sufficient exposure.

Once you feel you have enough exposure, apply for an internship in any startup focused on machine learning. Then try to convert into Full Time Employee.

All the best!!

Hope this helps :)",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-best-starting-jobs-to-eventually-enter-a-Machine-Learning-career?top_ans=84891742,2018-05-26T05:37:08.843774+00:00,,2,Anonymous,

How can I get a machine learning job in 9 months?,"I can not give guarantee that you will get job in 9 months but I will tell you how to get in-depth knowledge in machine learning field. That will definately help you to get a job. Afterall getting job depends on how hard and smart you work.

Follow the following steps to become machine learning expert.

1.Programming skills : Currently R programming and python programming are most used environments for programming in machine learning worldwide. So first of all get some basics and syntax in environment in which you want to do programming. As you are novice learner I will suggest you to go with python programming as it's easy programming language to learn rather than other languages. But both tools overcome each other in different domains. If you have some programming knowledge and you want to start with R programming then I will suggest you to download R studio and practice Swirl packages, it will help you to go through the basics and all syntax in R programming. You may refer following links:

 * Python 3.4 Programming Tutorials - YouTube [ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_ ]
 * swirl | Students [ http://swirlstats.com/students.html ]
2.Learning statistics: Machine learning is nothing but developing different statistical models for given datasets. So you should have better understanding of statistics. I will suggest you the book Introduction to statistical learning which explains all statistical concepts very well. In addition to this there are machine learning algorithms also explained with practical sessions using R programming. They used different datasets to execute different algorithms. Once you go through this book you done with 50% of work in machine learning.PDF of book available here: Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R - Usc - PDF Drive [ https://www.pdfdrive.net/introduction-to-statistical-learning-with-applications-in-r-usc-e8788524.html ]

3. Machine learning algorithms: Once you done with above take online course from Coursera: Machine Learning | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] .

If it's not possible for you to get online course you can find out video tutorials available on YouTube with same name and by same instructor. Instructor of this course is data scientist and he is one of the founders of Coursera MOOC. Here he explained all the concepts and machine learning algorithms very well with real time datasets in practicals. After this course you may done with machine learning. But the most important part starts now that is practicing over different datasets with different algorithms.

4.Implementation of algorithms: I think now you are capable to handle real time datasets. You may get lot of competitions and different real time datasets here: https://www.kaggle.com. Kaggle is home of data science and machine learning. You may learn, work and play with data here. It will make you stronger and you may get challenging problem over there. When you go through different problems apply different algorithms and come up with something better which may lead you to some research papers are transactions. This will definately help you to get a job in this field.

5.Stay connected over LinkedIn: Once you did all above things, your linkedIn profile will become too strong to fight any other apsirants preparing for job in this field. Lot of companies and HRs also looking for good profile over linkedIn so you may get noticed by them. This will give you opportunity to get start your carrier.

This is how you can get job in machine learning field. But question regarding 9 months, it's totally depends on your hard work and intelligence. But one thing is clear that if you will follow above procedure, you will definately become machine learning expert.

"I need to learn data science from scratch, where do I start?","Data Science is all about “using various techniques, algorithms to analyze large amounts of datasets (both structured & Unstructured), to extract useful data insights, thus applying them in various business domains.”

It’s a great time to become a data scientist, with a booming job market, lucrative salaries, and exciting career opportunities. What happens, though, if you have to start over?

There are fortunately many distinct learning paths available. There are numerous ways to acquire the necessary skills in the field, including attending boot camps, obtaining a college degree, and self-learning.

In my experience, before starting to learn you must be clear about the goal and things you need to learn.

So, let’s have a look at mandatory skills for Data Science.

Skills Required for Data Science-

 * Statistics
 * Mathematics
 * Programming Languages
 * Database Management
 * Data Visualization.
 * Machine Learning
So, these are must-have skills for a data scientist.

Job opportunity available and the goal you should look for in the field are,

 * Data Architect and Administrators
 * Data Engineer
 * Data Analyst
 * Data Scientist
 * Machine Learning Engineer
Steps to become a Data Scientist

Learn Python

Learning a computer language should be the First and Most Important Step Toward Data Science (ex. Python). Because of its simplicity, versatility, and pre-installed sophisticated libraries (including NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas) essential in data analysis and other elements of data science, Python is the most popular scripting language used by the majority of data scientists. The open-source programming language Python is compatible with several libraries. You can explore different playlists to begin with.

Learn Statistics

If Data Science is a language, then statistics is basically the grammar. Large data sets are analyzed and interpreted mostly using statistics. Statistics are as important to us as air when it comes to the processing of data and the discovery of new information. Large datasets provide many hidden details, which statistics can reveal.

Data Collection

One of the most crucial and significant steps in the field of data science is this one. This ability calls for an understanding of a variety of data import methods, including CSV files from local systems and the beautifulsoup Python module for scraping data from webpages. Scraping may also be based on an API. Knowledge of Python's ETL pipelines or the Query Language can be used to manage data collecting.

Data Cleaning

As a data scientist, this is the Step where the majority of your time is spent. Data cleaning is the process of taking the raw form of data and removing undesired values, missing values, category values, outliers, and records that were filed incorrectly in order to produce data that is suitable for analysis and work. Real-world data is messy by nature, so cleaning it up with the aid of several Python modules (such as Pandas and NumPy) is crucial for aspiring data scientists.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Machine learning is the core skill required to be a Data Scientist. Machine learning is used to build various predictive models, classification models, etc., and is being used by big firms, Companies to Optimize their planning as per the predictions. For example, Car Price prediction.

Deep Learning on the other hand is an advanced version of Machine Learning which deploys the use of Neural Network, a framework that combines various machine learning algorithms for solving various tasks, for training data. Various Neural networks are recurrent neural networks (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) etc.

Resources to begin your Training

If one wants to study data science, one needs to select a course that has areas of focus on important factors like domain knowledge, and hands-on projects which have real-world applications.

Other than online courses there are many ways to study data structures and algorithms like books, MOOCs, and YouTube tutorials. But going forward with online courses is better compared to other alternatives.

During my preparation I always used to find a topic and get the basics from YouTube, like why we are using a particular tool, it’s syntax but YouTube was never enough, it does not provide any structured material so then I used to move to my paid course (Logicmojo). There are many great courses available on the internet, I myself have purchased Logicmojo data science course to complete my data science knowledge for interview, though their course was enough yet for increasing my chances I have also purchased few project-based courses from Udemy as well.

Benefits of Logicmojo’s Data Science Courses

 * Your chance to learn and apply machine learning skills and Data Science techniques
 * Various tools that Data Scientists use are taught in Data Science course to practice with and learn from the best
 * The key skills needed to tackle and solve a data science problem are taught
 * Become experts in programming languages such as Python and SQL, which aids in learning Data Science, and understanding relational database concepts
 * Learn to import, clean, analyze, build and evaluate data models
 * Make use of data visualization techniques, libraries, and tools
 * Certified Data Scientist Certification is given after the successful completion of the course.
I have also had the pleasure to go through the courses of UpGrad and Scalar though my friends and colleagues, I have not gone in deep but I have a general idea –

Scaler Academy

Their courses are offered for both college students and working professionals with live classes which are conducted in an interactive fashion and weekly doubt clearing sessions are held. The courses are of long term duration which requires a dedicated daily 3-4 hours of work effort from the learner side. The course batch size is above 50+ students and the course fees is above INR 2 lakhs.

UpGrad

UpGrad is one of the leading ed-tech platforms which provides a course on PGP in Data Structure and Algorithm. The duration of the course is 12 months and the fees range from INR 2.5 lakhs to 2.8 lakhs respectively. The classes are offered in the form of pre-recorded videos and monthly live classes are commenced by the experts. The course comes with a certification and placement assistance is provided by them.

Practice

World’s Largest Data Science Communities like Kaggle, Analytics Vidhya is very helpful for getting in touch with various datasets and therefore can be used for practicing Various Data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms. Competitions being held in these communities are also useful for sharpening the skills of data science, thus helping us to achieve our goal of becoming proficient in Data Science faster.

Conclusion

Finally, I would like to say that data science is a great career path. The more you practice, the more knowledge of data science you will gain. So after completing these steps, don’t stop, just find new challenges and try to solve them.

You can learn data science on your own with online courses or even YouTube videos. There is no dearth of learning materials on the Internet if you’re working towards a career in this field. But that said, self-learning lacks structure, and you might not know what important elements you’re missing. Data science courses and bootcamps are a happy medium for those looking for independence and support, as they provide an experienced teacher and cohort setting to offer feedback, and in my opinion Logicmojo is a great place to prepare, although I will encourage you to do your on research take demo classes and then decide.

All the best and Happy coding.

How did you end up with your career in AI and Machine Learning?,"Slowly.

When I dropped out of high school I had no real skills. I was okay at doing things with a computer but wasn’t an incredible coder or anything like that. I started out building websites for friends and family, making enough money to eat and that’s about it.

After a while of doing that I got referred by a family member to a company who were looking for a SQL developer for a short term contract. I had no SQL skills but showed up to the interview and got the job - I had the right attitude.

Once that was contract was finished, I added SQL to my list of skills and slowly started building momentum as a database pro.

Reading around online I found that a popular certification for SQL developers was focussed on SQL Server Analysis Services, I had a look at the syllabus and found that data mining was mentioned a lot.

I studied data mining on my own, learnt the most common algorithms, learnt where I could fit it into my skillset. I won some freelance projects doing that.

Wanting to dig deeper, I studied Mathematics courses by distance learning, slowly building on my skills.

After a couple of years I had completed a fair amount of these courses and was getting a lot work in this new field of Machine Learning (in fact, data mining had just been renamed).

I applied the University of Oxford to study a yearlong course that was at the same level as an undergraduate degree. I didn’t get in the first time.

Finally, I was accepted to the course, worked hard at it and achieved a 93% average grade. During this time, my business grew and I was getting larger and larger projects from more important clients.

I caught the machine learning bug and really wanted to do research, so I applied to lots of PhD programmes. I got into one of them.

In order to focus more on my studies, I closed down my implementation business and started working with businesses on strategic engagements for very large projects.

I productised that offering and also started experimenting with doing machine learning training for in-house teams of developers.

Right now, I’m working on building online courses for people looking to make the jump to machine learning and also doing the occasional consulting project.

This is by no means the *standard* way to get work in machine learning, but it’s been an interesting path and I mention it here to show that you don’t have to go the traditional route.

What are some ways to begin a career in machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) without any prior experience?,"Starting a career in machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) without any experience might seem tough, but it's totally doable! Machine learning and AI are super popular in IT right now. They're not just a fad; they're here to stay, and they're used in tons of different industries like healthcare, finance, and advertising.

A lot of folks ask me how to get started in machine learning and AI. Let's break it down step by step. First, focus on the basics of computer science. Learn a little about everything: blockchain, compilers, operating systems, and more. It's like building up your toolkit for problem-solving.

Don't try to learn a bunch of coding languages at once. Stick to two that you like and that are popular right now. Learning too many languages at once can be overwhelming and not very helpful.

Once you've got the basics of computer science down, dive into the basics of data science and AI. Learn about the math behind the algorithms. Understanding the math is super important; it's like knowing the secret ingredients to a recipe.

Always ask questions about why certain algorithms exist and how they work. Understanding the ""why"" behind things is key to becoming a master in machine learning.

Even simple algorithms like Linear Regression aren't as simple as they seem. Take your time to really understand them, from the math to the implementation. It's like peeling an onion; there are lots of layers to uncover.

Keep learning! Stay up to date on the latest research papers and trends in machine learning and AI. Think of yourself as a sponge, soaking up knowledge from everywhere.

Be careful with online courses. Not all of them are good. Look for ones that focus on the nitty-gritty details, especially the math. Learning machine learning isn't something you can rush through in a couple of months.

Learn from the experts! Read blogs and case studies from big companies to see how they solve problems using machine learning and AI. It's like getting a peek behind the curtain at how the pros do it.

Give this roadmap a thumbs up if you found it helpful! Share it with others who are interested in machine learning and AI so they can learn too.

So, don't be afraid to dive into the world of machine learning and AI. It might seem daunting, but with the right approach, you can totally rock it! 🚀✨",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-secrets-to-getting-a-job-in-AI-and-Machine-Learning?top_ans=1477743750800051,2024-04-01T07:13:37.942513+00:00,,1,Anshul Shivhare,https://www.quora.com/profile/Anshul-Shivhare-8
What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"In my opinion, these are some of the necessary skills:

UPDATE: I create a repo on github of hundreds of software links that should help get you started: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning

1. Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5])

2. Probability and Statistics: A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.

3. Applied Math + Algorithms: For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16].

4. Distributed Computing: Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21].

5. Expertise in Unix Tools: Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1].

6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects: HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale.

7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques: feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though.

Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.

Good luck.

How can I get my first job in machine learning?,"Build a deep portfolio.

Most people think that portfolios should contain lots and lots of examples. That might work for designers but for people in a technical domain deep is better than wide. Just think of whitepapers and case studies - in depth explanations of what a consultancy did for a client.

If you’re seriously looking for a machine learning job I suggest that you find a data source related to the industry you’d like to work in (healthcare, sports, etc.) and go as deep as you can into the problems of that field.

Start by building simple models, work out why they work and why they don’t. Record what you do (I mean that literally and figuratively, use screen capture software to make videos and write about your process).

Then once you’ve understood the limitations of the simple models make more complex ones. Rinse and repeat.

Eventually you’ll have a really good understanding of the industry, the data sources, and which methods work in which cases. That beats a certification earned by building a dog breeds classifier every time.

Businesses might want people who are experts in machine learning, but they need people who are experts in applying machine learning to their industry. Be that person.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-secrets-to-getting-a-job-in-AI-and-Machine-Learning?top_ans=128742632,2019-03-19T18:14:57.294777+00:00,,16,Carl Dawson,https://www.quora.com/profile/Carl-Dawson-21
What are the steps to take in becoming a machine learning and AI specialist?,"It’s the same process for everyone.

Here’s the machine learning pipeline.

Regardless of your degrees or experience the person who can work the end to end machine learning pipeline really well will make big coin and have a great career.

AI is a container. Inside that container are sub-fields like machine learning. Inside machine learning is deep learning and traditional learning.

Here’s what you’ll need to know:

1. data sourcing
2. data wrangling
3. modeling
4. putting model in prod
While the steps look fairly easy in bullet point form in reality they are brutally difficult.

For example, most models right now are sourced from relational databases. Therefore you’ll need to know SQL really well. Not so easy if you don’t come from a data background. To make matters worse most companies won’t even look at your cv if you don’t have 3–5 years of real world SQL experience. That’s just step one on our bullet points above. So, to even be considered you’ll need 3–5 years of data related experience.

Here’s a typical job for a machine learning engineer.

"Is it worth learning ""machine learning"" (artificial intelligence? If so can one get a job?","About 1.5y ago, I spend 4 month in Aalto University, Finland, to intensively study Machine Learning. I knew it was definitely intersting, but, as it was my final year, I would soon have to chose what to do the year after. My decision was to do as much machine learning as possible to see if it was worth spending more time on it.

In turns out I’m starting a Ph. D.

Considering I spent some time wondering the same question, I’ll give you my point of view, as objective as I can, but definitely biased, as I find this topic fascinating, and considering this answer echoes to a personal situation.


The first question coming into my mind when I read your question is: “What do you consider worth?”

Considering this question has to be answered before we continue, I’ll give a subjective answer, how I did answered it, and what I led me to think/do.

1. Learning is worth I do think that the learning process in inherently interesting. So basically, I would tend to answer yes if you were asking “Is it worth to learn %3Canything%3E”
2. Follow your curiosity if you find something somehow interesting, it is definitely worth to learn it. For yourself.
3. It it really interesting? I personally think that any complex topic is interesting. With complex meaning that you can’t just come, look at the thing, and make a statement about the whole thing in a minute. Complex meaning there is a lot of uncertainty, a lot of knowledge to discover. Useless to say that this point is OK for Machine Learning.
4. Does someone cares about it? Learning interesting things is marvelous, learning useful things is even better! By useful, I mean, that can give you something back. It could be a job, money, or virtually anything. That’s where we see the worth as defined not only by you, but also by your environment. Type “Machine Learning” in Google, you may find that, in fact, quite a lot of people do care about it.
5. Can I do it my work? If something can give you job opportunities, it is definitely worth it. In fact, I do think that any kind of Machine Learning you learn will be directly worth on a CV. You could then, obviously, get a work in this field, but also, if your work does not require machine learning, it would be a super good point to show you learned it. It tells interesting about you: you are interested about various field (not only your work), you work on your spare time to improve yourself on various skills etc…
BONUS: I talked about jobs. I guess the reality is way better than what I just said. Not only it could give opportunities, ML could give you super-good opportunities. There are tons of jobs, tons of money here just waiting for you. Machine Learning needs everything: scientists (Ph.D) are welcomed, but also engineers, technicians, and for sure, more and more jobs will closely work with data-related guy.

Yes, yes, yes, it is worth, every minute spent on it is worth, both in the intellectual and physical world.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-secrets-to-getting-a-job-in-AI-and-Machine-Learning?top_ans=39399302,2017-03-17T17:28:16.715451+00:00,,26,Paul Tardy,https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Tardy

I disagree with some of the “educators” who said all you need to know is the application of Machine Learning, calling some APIs, and magic happens. It might be a good way of pushing out some of more “mature” ML use cases (i.e. facial recognition), but it really is for “non-data scientists” who can use some of the well-proven algorithms only.

To be a Machine Learning specialist, you really need to know the statistics. The reason behind those algorithms, and most importantly the caveats — in what sense the data, the algorithm, the scenario might not produce results that are “take for granted” (think about the facial recognition scandal at google, or Tay at Microsoft).

So, learn the fundamentals of the math, at least to the degree you can discuss the caveats further.

Then take the knowledge you learned, start practicing on some low-stake topics, learning AI theory is good, but practice gives you broader experience and acquire knowledge and skills that are needed to apply the theory in reality. You will find that “application” is as hard as the math itself.

Then repeat, and you can take on more complex, higher stake problems as you grow your skills and experience.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-secrets-to-getting-a-job-in-AI-and-Machine-Learning?top_ans=113951268,2018-12-23T20:45:18.471604+00:00,,1,Alan Tan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Alan-Tan-70

Follow the following steps to become machine learning expert.

1.Programming skills : Currently R programming and python programming are most used environments for programming in machine learning worldwide. So first of all get some basics and syntax in environment in which you want to do programming. As you are novice learner I will suggest you to go with python programming as it's easy programming language to learn rather than other languages. But both tools overcome each other in different domains. If you have some programming knowledge and you want to start with R programming then I will suggest you to download R studio and practice Swirl packages, it will help you to go through the basics and all syntax in R programming. You may refer following links:

 * Python 3.4 Programming Tutorials - YouTube [ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_ ]
 * swirl | Students [ http://swirlstats.com/students.html ]
2.Learning statistics: Machine learning is nothing but developing different statistical models for given datasets. So you should have better understanding of statistics. I will suggest you the book Introduction to statistical learning which explains all statistical concepts very well. In addition to this there are machine learning algorithms also explained with practical sessions using R programming. They used different datasets to execute different algorithms. Once you go through this book you done with 50% of work in machine learning.PDF of book available here: Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R - Usc - PDF Drive [ https://www.pdfdrive.net/introduction-to-statistical-learning-with-applications-in-r-usc-e8788524.html ]

3. Machine learning algorithms: Once you done with above take online course from Coursera: Machine Learning | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] .

If it's not possible for you to get online course you can find out video tutorials available on YouTube with same name and by same instructor. Instructor of this course is data scientist and he is one of the founders of Coursera MOOC. Here he explained all the concepts and machine learning algorithms very well with real time datasets in practicals. After this course you may done with machine learning. But the most important part starts now that is practicing over different datasets with different algorithms.

4.Implementation of algorithms: I think now you are capable to handle real time datasets. You may get lot of competitions and different real time datasets here: https://www.kaggle.com. Kaggle is home of data science and machine learning. You may learn, work and play with data here. It will make you stronger and you may get challenging problem over there. When you go through different problems apply different algorithms and come up with something better which may lead you to some research papers are transactions. This will definately help you to get a job in this field.

5.Stay connected over LinkedIn: Once you did all above things, your linkedIn profile will become too strong to fight any other apsirants preparing for job in this field. Lot of companies and HRs also looking for good profile over linkedIn so you may get noticed by them. This will give you opportunity to get start your carrier.

This is how you can get job in machine learning field. But question regarding 9 months, it's totally depends on your hard work and intelligence. But one thing is clear that if you will follow above procedure, you will definately become machine learning expert.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is generally conceived as the application of mathematics, statistics and data analytics and programming to the modelling (primarily) of the functions of the human brain.

The advocates of the ‘Techno-Singularity’ expect that such an AI modelling might one day lead to an irreversible and uncontrollable explosion of ever more intelligent machines; for there seems obvious to all that there is an almost limitless potential for further, equally significant AI discoveries in the future. {Why Machine Will Never Rule the World: AI Without Fear, 2023}

To start, follow its simple general description:

“In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms work by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data.”

Learn a triple of basic learning methods:

Supervised learning infers a function from labeled training data.

Unsupervised learning finds previously unknown patterns in data set without pre-existing labels.

Reinforcement learning is concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize a cumulative reward.

So, you need to study a bit of applied mathematics, statistics and programming.

How can one become a good machine learning engineer?,"The other answers do a great job covering the technical aspects of this question, such as the fundamentals you need to learn, the courses you should take, the papers you should read etc. I'm going to cover this question from another angle and talk about the traits you need to have or be able to cultivate in order to be a good machine learning engineer. 

Here is a list of must-have traits, in no particular order:

 * You need to enjoy an iterative process of development. If you want to build a machine learning system, you need to be able to build a version 0.1 using a very simple model quickly. Then iterate on getting it better at every successive stage.
 * You also need to have a good intuition for when to stop. In any machine learning system, you can always improve the accuracy by iterating on it more. But at some point, the effort you put into it exceeds the value you derive from it. You need to be able to identify that point.
 * You should be comfortable with failure. A lot of your models and experiments will fail. And that’s ok.
 * You should be driven by curiosity. The best people are the ones who are genuinely curious about the world around them and channel that curiosity when working on machine learning.
 * You need to have a good data intuition. You should be good at identifying patterns in the data. Being able to create quick data visualizations (using R, Python, Matlab or Excel etc.) helps.
 * You need to have a good sense of metrics and be metrics-driven. You should to be able to establish metrics that define success or failure of your system. You should feel comfortable with blind experiments [1]  and terms like precision, recall, accuracy, ROC, conversion rates, NDCG etc.
 * Metrics are great at giving a high level view of how your system is doing. But at the same time, you should never stop directly looking at individual examples. Manually looking at your biggest wins and your biggest losses (e.g. worst performing queries for a search engine), as well as random samples of your data, teaches you a lot about your machine learning system that raw metrics don’t.
 * You should be able to develop a generalized approach to fixing the bugs/misclassifications in your models. Fixing individual bugs will only let you attain a local maxima. More often that not, individual fixes will also make your models more complex and harder to work with. Gathering all the issues together and identifying common themes will let you focus on the biggest impact issues that you can fix in your next round of iteration.
 * When developing your models, you should be able to put yourself in the minds of the users / customers of your system. It’s easy to build something that’s good enough for you. But your current and future users matter way more than you do. There are also a lot of biases [2] that affect individual decision making, and you should try to be aware of and account for as many of them as possible.

What is the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence?,"Machine Learning is the only kind of AI there is.

AI is changing. We are now recognizing that most things called ""AI"" in the past are nothing more than advanced programming tricks. As long as the programmer is the one supplying all the intelligence to the system by programming it in as a World Model, the system is not really an Artificial Intelligence. It's ""just a program"".

Don't model the World; Model the Mind.

When you Model the Mind you can create systems capable of Learning everything about the world. It is a much smaller task, since the world is very large and changes behind your back, which means World Models will become obsolete the moment they are made. The only hope to create intelligent systems is to have the system itself create and maintain its own World Models. Continuously, in response to sensory input.

Following this line of reasoning, Machine Learning is NOT a subset of AI. It really is the ONLY kind of AI there is.

And this is now proving to be true, and in a big way. Since 2012, a specific Machine Learning technique called Deep Learning is taking the AI world by storm. Researchers are abandoning the classical ""Programming Tricks"" style of AI in droves and switching to Deep Learning... based mainly on the fact that it actually works. We've made more progress in three years since 2012 than we've done in the preceeding 25 years on several key AI problems, including Image Understanding (a really hard one), Signal Processing, Voice Understanding, and Text Understanding.

Another clue that we are now on the right track: Old style AI projects like CYC ran to millions of propositions or millions of lines of code. Systems that (successfully) Model the Mind can be as small as 600 lines of code; several recent Deep Learning projects clock in somewhere in that range. And these programs can move from one problem domain to another with very few changes to the core; this means these methods are GENERAL intelligences, not specific to any one problem domain. This is why it is called Artificial General Intelligence. And we've never had any AI programs that could do this in the past. As an example, the language understanding programs we are creating using DL will work equally well in any language, not just English. It just takes a re-training to switch to Japanese... another indication that Deep Learning is closer to true intelligence than traditional NLP systems.

Google is currently using Machine Learning a lot - in my estimate, over a hundred places in their systems have been replaced by Deep Learning and other ML techniques in the past few years. even their patented ""PageRank"" algorithm which was the initial key to their success is being replaced, even as I write this, with a new algorithm called ""RankBrain"" which is based on Deep Learning. In the shareholder's call last week, the CEO of Google said that they were looking at using ML (probably Deep Learning) *everywhere* in all their products. More generally, I expect a deluge of apps and systems that understand languages and images in the next several years, all based on Deep Learning.

I really shouldn't confuse things but strictly speaking, Deep Learning is not AI either. We are currently using Supervised Deep Learning, which is another (but less critical) programmer's cheat since the ""supervision"" is a kind of World Model. Real AI requires Unsupervised Deep Learning. Many people including myself are working on this; it is possibly thousands of times more difficult than Supervised Learning. But this is where we have to go.

Deep Learning isn't AI but it's the only thing we have that's on the path to True AI.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-are-the-secrets-to-getting-a-job-in-AI-and-Machine-Learning?top_ans=77661,2010-08-03T16:40:45.914251+00:00,2017-10-31T05:27:30.230464+00:00,876,Monica Anderson,https://www.quora.com/profile/Monica-Anderson
Is it possible for someone who has no CS degree to learn machine learning and get a job?,"I have no CS degree. I only ever took one intro to CS class. I started with ML earlier this year and have several interviews coming up with companies that reached out to me through Quora. In fact, one of them is in 14 hours.

The truth is that they stop caring what degree you have and where you got it the moment you walk in the door. The diploma itself is nothing more than a tool to get you into that door. Having a CS degree just tells a company that you might not be a total waste of time to interview. If you don't have the degree, you just need to show it in a different way.

For me, that way was answering questions on Quora. That's not why I answer on Quora, but it’s a nice bonus. It doesn't have to be the same for you though. You can do anything as long as it demonstrates that you have expertise—that you are competent in this field to the point where they might benefit from your skills.

The major difficulty is that you usually have to do it in the form of a resume. That's a short document that will likely just be skimmed. You're better off making them aware of your existence before they even know if you have a CS degree or not. Do an interesting project and put it on GitHub. Better yet, contribute to open source libraries. Start your own open source project. Anything that shows “I know how to do this.”

If you want to be a little more…uh… I guess original is the word, you could do something like this: train a style transfer convolutional network to basically just recreate an image by writing “hire (your name here)” all over the place. Then just put that at the top of your resume. Make sure the results look really good though. Your goal here is just to get them to read a little more carefully. After that, you can describe how you made the style transfer network.

That approach will be pretty hit-or-miss, I'd expect, but all you really need is a few hits.",https://www.quora.com/Will-getting-a-degree-in-CS-help-me-to-get-into-machine-learning-and-AI?top_ans=43854318,2017-05-08T03:31:09.773679+00:00,,179,Anonymous,

Can I learn and get a job in Machine Learning without studying CS Master and PhD?,"You can, but it is far more difficult than when I got into the field. Until the depression in the 2000s, having a degree at all was a plus if it was considered at all with most employers. Few cared if you had a degree at all much less what it was in. 

Today it is difficult getting a decent IT job without at least a 4 year degree. Not impossible. Machine learning is one of those advanced jobs, entry level people are not even given the time of day typically. If you don't have 10 years industry experience as a developer, your probably not even going to get your resume looked at. BUT there are ways around that and ways to get industry experience without working for anybody. 

First, no degree program is going to teach you ANY programming language. The course are far to short to do anything but give you the barest introduction. Usually they are taught by people who've never worked in the industry or at least with that language. They often teach very bad habits as short cuts. As a project lead or project manager I dreaded being handed fresh graduates. I spent more time unteaching them very bad habits they learned than I did teaching them how to program. I spent far more time teaching them than they spent writing useful code and I or one of my crew usually had to rewrite everything they wrote until they'd been at it for at least six months. 

You learn how to code by coding. There is no substitute. No short cut. No course that can teach you anything but how to get started. You want to learn how to code. First decide to write something. Pick modest goals at first. You'll be amazed how difficult they can be. Then use the languages you plan to learn to accomplish those goals. Even if they are as simple as a too do list, you'll learn a ton by actually doing it. Even if your first programs are going to be inferior to existing programs. Then write more advance programs. Once you master that stage, write software for somebody else. ANYBODY else. They'll force you to learn a ton, as they'll ask for things which will stretch your skills. 

Next get involved in OSS projects. Learn from the code you interact with and you'll gain practical industry experience writing the code. It's even better if you apply to a company that uses code you wrote. You can point to an app and say I am part of that project. Goes a long way to winning a job. Especially when you have no paid industry experience. 

Then as you master programming in the languages you'll be using, THEN tackle machine learning, AI and intelligent assistants. You'll want to learn Smalltalk, CLIPS, LISP, C++ and Python,  Java is another that can be invaluable, knowing PHP, Xcode, Ruby, PERL, and .NET are going to be a really good idea. Don't worry, once you know one language, it's a whole lot easier learning others, the exceptions being Java and LISP.  Today being a programmer and not knowing SQL is like driving a car and not knowing how to change a tire. NoSQL is gaining traction out there as well and it'd be wise to learn it. R programming is also something your going to learn whether you like it or not. 

While you are learning that, start with Donald Hebbs work. It is really the foundation of all AI and machine learning. The Psychology jargon might be a little daunting, but you can muddle through that for the foundations of neural nets and machine learning. Piaget is another Psychologist which you'll want to at least learn the basics of their work. 

Then get involved in OSS machine learning projects. Get your industry experience there. OSS projects are always desperate for developers. 

Finally you can get an industry job doing it. 

As an alternate, learn how to write machine learning on your own. Then develop your own OSS project or commercial piece of software to solve a problem and make your own doorway into the industry.

In this era of free MOOCs upgrading yourself is not difficult. You can have a Bachelors in Economics/Mathematics/Statistics or even Literature but you have to be quite good with basic mathematics to get a good grasp of ML models. There are several courses in Coursera, Analytics Vidhya, Edureka, DataQuest, KDNuggets, GeeksforGeeks which one can use to learn.

Participate in hackathons and competitions in Kaggle. Make mistakes and learn from it. That is the best way to teach yourself any skill in any domain.

It’s better to do Masters in AI and DataScience than just CS if the career to be pursued is in Machine Learning.

Prerequisites of a ML expert - Knowledge in Python/R, Good knowledge in SQL, Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra, Probability, Stochastic Calculus, Inferential Statistics. If it’s more niche role, Graph theory or Discreet mathematics will also be required above them.

What I really think is very very important is knowing few things and as you get familiar with this the older stuffs you read makes more sense. It might look a lot but if you consume slowly bit by bit you will understand a lot in sometime.

so 1st thing you should learn is Linear Algebra at an intuitive level and understand the computational issues. 
A large part of Multiple veiw geometry in computer vision is linear algebra and a bit of optimization. This will make you aprreciate it more. (sorry for ignoring tensors.. anyways it gives headaches)

2nd thing is understanding probability and statistic. Useful in understanding Graphical models and Deep Learning. Note: Graphical model is a major topic in machine learning.

3rd would be watching/rewatching a standard machine learning lectures. Like the one by mathmatical monk on youtube, learning from data, Andrew Ng's longer version of course. I would also suggest you to read all the lecture notes of Andrew Ng's Class.

4th for getting a flavour of optimization start with linear programming. The one at coursera is a great intro into this(The one by UoColorado). There are others which might be a bit more serious and some more insights.

5th would be deeper into optimization(Convex optimization). The one by BOYD is awesome.

Maybe be now comes the time to read a standard ML text. Reading about probability, statistics, information theory, inference would also be useful. (This can be done in parallel with video lectures.)

NOTE: this is not a race which you need to finish fast. Just keep learning take your time. If you really try to do it fast you will be overwhelmed by the content which will force you to ask more questions like these. :P

Other things not in answer which is also a part of knowing ML well are scalablity, functional analysis, Advanced optimization, compressed sensing, Probablistic Graphical Models ,Approximate inference.

Btw I am running a year machine learning course. Ofcourse there is a limitation in how much can be covered in a year. But it's a good well balanced course for beginners and intermediates.

Is it possible for someone who has no CS degree to learn machine learning and get a job?,"Yes it’s possible. It is unorthodox but definitely possible. Several members of the Google Brain team have provided their backgrounds on a reddit AMA here [ https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4w6tsv/ama_we_are_the_google_brain_team_wed_love_to/d64khp9/ ]. There is one researcher with no college degree, an art history major, an english major, and an economics/finance major.

The main thing to remember is the power of just asking for an opportunity/chance. You might not have the background but if you simply ask, show interest and show that you have a direction (in this case towards machine learning), the people you ask have no right to stop you. You do have to work hard to prove yourself but you can definitely do it.",https://www.quora.com/Will-getting-a-degree-in-CS-help-me-to-get-into-machine-learning-and-AI?top_ans=43852009,2017-05-08T02:48:44.110806+00:00,,14,Samiur Khan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Samiur-Khan-2
What's the next step after getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science if I want to do a research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning?,"Disclaimer: I am not a machine learning/artificial intelligence expert or actively working in ML/AI. I took 1 course in ML in my undergrad, still however, I hope that I can share some insight.

If I were trying to do research in ML/AI there are several things I would do:

 * Take an online course in Machine Learning/AI (Udacity/Coursera are good sources from what I hear)
 * Network with engineers working in the field. Go to meetups/conferences to meet engineers working in the field.
 * Look at various graduate programs that might interest you, see what kind of problems the professors there working on. Read their research.
 * Dabble around with various ML/AI frameworks. Like with most things in SE, some frameworks can be better for solving certain kinds of problems.
 * Checkout out this popular ML roadmap repo on Github [ https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers ]
 * Listen to the experts: Andrew Ng, Andrej Karpathy, Geoffrey Hinton
One thing to note about working on Machine Learning Research it’s very different to working in the industry.

In particular, working in ML/AI research you’d be working on something novel, where as with industry, the goal is to solve problems using methods that have been tried before.

Hope this helps and best of luck!",https://www.quora.com/Will-getting-a-degree-in-CS-help-me-to-get-into-machine-learning-and-AI?top_ans=89357918,2018-06-29T20:51:43.327574+00:00,2018-06-29T20:59:13.846890+00:00,5,Oscar Parra,https://www.quora.com/profile/Oscar-Parra-17
Can I learn and get a job in Machine Learning without studying CS Master and PhD?,"In this age, where schools and books are being made obsolete by MOOCs and programming websites (at least in the field of Computer Science), yes you can, and you should. 

 Let's take 'Machine Learning Engineer' as a running example. In their daily role, they build/test/deploy machine learning systems that can classify/analyse hundreds of data. They are not expected to take state-of-the-art methods further, they only need to be aware of the tools to use for their specific purpose.

I think a good combination of programming skills, coupled with a good machine learning foundation (being aware of classification and clustering algorithms, being able to understand mathematical formulas and tricks stated in the papers) is enough for that role, as a beginner. 

You will see an image below, an open position at Palantir [3], a machine learning and data analysis giant based in USA. The formal position is here: Software Engineer (Machine Learning) [ https://www.palantir.com/careers/positions/software-engineer-machine-learning/ ]

Figure.1 A machine learning engineer job requirements and desirable skills at Palantir[3]

What do they want? They require BS in CS, communication skills to understand customer needs, data cleaning and processing skills and strong programming  (C/C++) and scripting (Python, R) background. 

You need to understand base algorithms on machine learning. You may check Andrew NG's excellent machine learning course [2] from Coursera for this. Weekly assignments held in Matlab will enable you to do hands-on experience with a scripting language while understanding the algorithms. I strongly suggest you to read excellent  ""A few useful things to know about machine learning"" from Pedro Domingos [1]. 

You should be aware of available machine learning libraries which will fuel your work when it comes to implementation [6]

Then, you can go further and set-up a distributed computing platform (Hadoop, Spark, etc) in your own desktop [4]. As you probably do not have so many clusters to distribute work across, you can work on a virtual machine version of Spark. Then, you may try to implement the same algorithms told in the machine learning course using Python, in a distributed or single machine setting. This will allow you to think in terms of 'scalability' of algorithms, which is one of the important skills as an engineer. You may use a scalable algorithm or find a way to distribute workload to clusters. 

You can even go further and join Kaggle [5] competitions which is an excellent place to compete with people for different real-world problems. 

What you have done so far? You understood the basics of machine learning algorithms, you implemented them using scripting languages, you experience distributed computing platforms, and you even compete with real people on real-world data problems. OK, a masters will not hurt your chance for doing all of these, but who really need this in today's world? 

Good Luck.

Can I get into AI/Machine Learning for Masters with a Computational Cognitive Science undergraduate degree? Or would a strict Computer Science degree be more helpful?,"I would suggest first taking a look at Scott E. Fahlman's answer to Is computer science and cognitive science a good combo? Is this worth it? Are there any other better combo choices for an undergraduate student who wants to go to a graduate school and do AI in the future? [ https://qr.ae/TUn6qM ]

Then consider what part of AI/Machine Learning it is that you really like and want to pursue.

If you want to go the standard route of ML, then probably a strict CS degree + advanced physics/math and statistics would be the most helpful. There you can learn to work with a lot of data and uncertainty about models.

Recently there has been a lot of work in neuro-inspired ML architectures such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), etc. (Some of these were actually discovered independently, which is super cool that engineers stumbled upon the same things as brain development). So if you’re into studying these kinds of things, then I think that studying Cognitive Science or Computational Neuroscience, while also taking CS/Math/Physics/Stats courses, would be a fantastic way to go.

How can a CS major get into machine learning?,"You can follow the ML course by Andrew NG on coursera. This is will be quite basic and can give an insight about the topic. To go deeper, follow the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book by Christopher M. Bishop, a researcher at Microsoft. The book on Pattern Recognition by Duda, Stork and Hart will be a good source of extensive reading. And then later you can get the feel of real life problems on Kaggle.

Should I choose artificial intelligence or software engineering?,"Applied artificial intelligence is software engineering with more math and data wrangling.

If you work in a research department and never have to actually put an AI model into production, you might get away without strong software engineering skills. But those roles are few and far between and almost all require a PhD.

But if you are an AI engineer working in the applied space, you are going to do a lot of software engineering work.

So the most sensible path is to become a software engineer first and then learn the AI-specific skills and gradually transition into AI/ML.

That’s what I did. I’ve done machine learning (the most promising subfield of AI) in University. Most of it was theoretical research and I wasn’t able to find a job as an AI engineer right out of University. So I’ve spent several years as a Java engineer mainly building distributed applications in the cloud and later as a native Android and iOS developer. This gave me a lot of software engineering experience which finally qualified me to tackle applied ML. Then I gradually moved over into applied machine learning.

Finding a graduate position as a software engineer is much easier and also makes more sense. AI/ML in the enterprise is still a novel field and most companies don’t really understand it.

Will AI replace physicists? Is it safe to major in physics and choose a research career in physics in the new age of AI?,"Any article that starts with “AI is a threat to…” tends to be sensationalist. And using that as a basis of even claiming that choosing a career in physics research is in any way going to be problematic in the “new age of AI” is a misunderstanding of what AI actually does.

For example, I shall start with how computers, and programming revolutionised astronomy. Even about 40 years ago, astronomers used to look at thousands of photographic plates, or several hundred metres of graphing papers with light curves etched onto them, to detect various astronomical bodies by eye.

This was an extremely tedious task, and slowed astronomy down quite a bit. Further, it limited the data processing capabilities to human levels, which further put a constraint on the amount of data collected at a time. However, in came computers which could be made to read the data rapidly. Programming allowed faster detections, as the data could be run at blazing fast speeds, which have improved enough to allow terabytes of data to be processed almost daily.

Now that the astronomers weren’t responsible for directly detecting sources, were they suddenly irrelevant? The answer is no. Programming was a tool using which repetitive work, or work that can be done faster through computers was achieved. Knowing what to look for, knowing why we are looking for them, their physical significance, error corrections to results from the program and more were the astronomer’s input.

Coming to the AI Physicist in the article, it is definitely a great tool. It can be presented with environments based on which it can figure out the laws necessary, sure. But it is far from a replacement. It needs to be accurately coded. It works with electromagnetic potentials, harmonic potentials etc. on a rigid object. But how about particulate matter? How well does it handle hydrodynamics of a magnetic fluid? How “physical” are its solutions? All of this needs to be checked and fed in by a physicist.

For example, using unsupervised learning, I could get a great fit for some experiment. However, what may happen that the fit while minimising residuals, settles into a local minima, and thus ends up throwing unphysical answers, when actually tested.

Fig: My AI has found the solution by minimising errors to the local minimum. As the errors rise on either side, it may not choose to explore any further. Unless given a push. Who gives the push?

What is thus needed is to push the solution to the global minima of errors. And who can correct for this? The physicist.

In today’s world, physics is seeing an increasing amount of usage of AI and ML. We can use them to “teach” our machines physics, so that it can handle lots of data. But who teaches them? Who corrects them when they make errors? Who evaluates the physical significance of their results? Who even gives them the data to analyse? And who decides what is data?

The answer is: the physicists.

So right now, it is not only safe, but an incredible time to major in physics. We have the best tools to our disposal, and can use it to revolutionise the field, and human life at large. But to exaggerate the tools to imagine them to have capabilities they don’t have, would be an engagement with unnecessary sensationalism.

Hence, go for it.",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-get-into-artificial-intelligence-after-a-computer-science-degree?top_ans=235161065,2020-08-25T07:05:36.719801+00:00,2020-08-25T07:55:23.978208+00:00,41,Anshuman Acharya,https://www.quora.com/profile/Anshuman-Acharya-10
Will AI decrease the demand for ML/AI engineers in the long term? Should i give up studying Computer Science?,"Oh, great! Another person thinking they can just give up studying Computer Science because AI is going to swoop in and steal all the jobs. Well, let me tell you something, my friend. AI may be advancing, but that doesn't mean you should throw in the towel just yet.

Sure, AI is making strides in various industries, and it's true that it can automate certain tasks that were previously done by humans. But that doesn't mean it's going to eliminate the need for ML/AI engineers altogether. In fact, it's quite the opposite.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, the demand for skilled ML/AI engineers is only going to increase. You see, AI doesn't magically create itself. It needs humans like you to design, develop, and maintain it. And let me tell you, that's not a job just anyone can do.

So, if you're thinking about giving up on Computer Science because you're scared of AI taking over, think again. The field of ML/AI is evolving rapidly, and there's a whole world of opportunities waiting for those who have the skills and knowledge to navigate it.

Sure, AI may change the landscape of certain job roles, but it also opens up new avenues and creates new possibilities. Instead of running away from it, embrace the challenge. Adapt, learn, and stay ahead of the game. That's how you secure your place in the future of technology.

So, my advice to you is this: don't be a quitter. Stick with Computer Science, dive deeper into ML/AI, and become a force to be reckoned with. The demand for ML/AI engineers isn't going anywhere, my friend. It's only going to grow. Now, get back to your studies and show the world what you're made of!

How can I pursue both computer science and artificial intelligence in college?,"Well , it isn’t seems like a problem till now to me . If you have a crystal clear mindset for AI , start learning any language , preferably start with C then jump to C++ or Python . For sure Python is more used and preferred for AI over C++ but data structures can be done efficiently with C++ ( my own experience ) .

Also , don’t allow your most enthusiastic mindset which one carries after listening to VEVO dj songs by Justin or Selena :p . Cool down . It needs practise , you cannot skip anything in between but thorough in depth learning everything else ( talking here of the other non core subjects other than Maths ) will be foolishness . Also , they can be done by proper time management techniques and “you will have good GPA to show and shine before Gupta JI ka ladka :p.”

So after three languages , make some projects over them , Side wise start learning AI from edx or coursera . EDX is Great though .

Find a way to start with , I prefer Natural Language Processing , Vision , Robotics , Locomation , Predictive Analysis etc. They are exciting to get into with . Vision I prefer as a large number of projects can be made with openCV algo only and can be implemented in short run . Go theoretical too . Most of the So called world Class developers only make projects and always be ignorant to theory part . Trust me , there is one in a million who crack it without touching any book .

So , C , C++ , Dynamic Programming , Paradigms of Programming ( OOP , Procedural , functional , Imperative ) , Algorithm design and Analysis , Python are mandatory prerequisites .

Also , AI is something taught in the last stages of B.tech , if you aren’t comfortable with it and still finds time in your daily routine , learn

LINUX , SEO , Microprocessor , Crypto Currencies , UI/UX etc.

PS: you can start AI at parallel online but never ever ruin something which is being taught for something which is going to be or something which already has been.

Remember that AI is a rapidly evolving field, and staying updated with the latest research, technologies, and industry trends is vital. Continuous learning through online courses, attending conferences, joining AI communities, and following reputable sources in the field will help you stay competitive and advance your AI engineering career.",https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-be-an-artificial-intelligence-engineer-which-should-I-study-computer-science-or-software-engineer?top_ans=1477743688031485,2023-08-16T18:44:48.142160+00:00,,0,Khalid Fakeeh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Khalid-Fakeeh
Should I choose artificial intelligence or software engineering?,"Applied artificial intelligence is software engineering with more math and data wrangling.

If you work in a research department and never have to actually put an AI model into production, you might get away without strong software engineering skills. But those roles are few and far between and almost all require a PhD.

But if you are an AI engineer working in the applied space, you are going to do a lot of software engineering work.

So the most sensible path is to become a software engineer first and then learn the AI-specific skills and gradually transition into AI/ML.

That’s what I did. I’ve done machine learning (the most promising subfield of AI) in University. Most of it was theoretical research and I wasn’t able to find a job as an AI engineer right out of University. So I’ve spent several years as a Java engineer mainly building distributed applications in the cloud and later as a native Android and iOS developer. This gave me a lot of software engineering experience which finally qualified me to tackle applied ML. Then I gradually moved over into applied machine learning.

Finding a graduate position as a software engineer is much easier and also makes more sense. AI/ML in the enterprise is still a novel field and most companies don’t really understand it. So they want someone with experience who can take charge of projects, not a rookie who needs to be trained.",https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-be-an-artificial-intelligence-engineer-which-should-I-study-computer-science-or-software-engineer?top_ans=277209570,2021-04-19T08:03:51.755359+00:00,,122,Sebastian Kirsch,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sebastian-Kirsch-2
"I want to be an artificial intelligence engineer, which should I study, computer science or software engineer?","All of the original AI work was done by cognitive psychologists, because it was thought that they were the best option for making a machine capable of thinking like a person. I had a work-study job for one, in college, writing code in Prolog and LISP, in fact.

When it was realized that Minsky had it all wrong with his “society of mind” model, people started modeling artificial neural networks instead. And the CS people took over AI, because they were able to get actual forward progress. Or at lest spin off a bunch of useful and therefore monetizable technologies in the process of their research.

So if you want to design the algorithms, probably CS. If you want to write code, probably SWE.

But realize, that when I went to school, CS was a thing, and SWE was merely an “emphasis” you could elect, and everyone had to learn 5 or 6 programming languages, in language-specific classes.

Today, you might learn “database theory, using C”, and be on your own in learning the language itself, unless you go to a top-tier school, and take the harder option, if there are multiple degree tracks.

For example, CS-101 at Harvard is pretty much a C language class, and if you can’t pass it, you aren’t getting a CS degree from Harvard.

Other top universities also still teach language classes, so that you know how to use your tools, before you are expected to use them on something.

Should I choose artificial intelligence or software engineering?,"It is a misconception among the laymen that AI and SE have to be two distinct career paths. If you are indecisive, just go with both.

If you want to become a data scientist or AI researcher, you have to be decently good at software engineering, and vice versa. There are high demands in silicon valley for talents with hybrid skillsets in both AI and SE. The line is so blurred such that you could transit between AI and SE roles easily in tech giants like FANG

AI and SE are so interconnected.

Software projects (such as Tensorflow, OpenCog, Label Studio etc.) support the whole ecosystem of AI R&D, to cope with the rapidly increasing complexity and requirements of the AI models.

To make a AI model practical, you have to make sure it can be integrated in a software architecture. You have to make sure it is maintainable and scalable. You have to make sure it is cost efficient. That means you have to be knowledgeable in database design, operating system, software design, algorithm and architecture.

On the other hand, it does not make sense to be an expert in software engineering without knowing AI. As AI continue to advance, AI will become a general tool used in typical software projects.

AI will be one of the core knowledges every software developer need to master. It is just a part of software engineering, along with technologies like database, cloud architecture, distributed system, security, compilers, operating system, user experience, automated testing, etc.",https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-be-an-artificial-intelligence-engineer-which-should-I-study-computer-science-or-software-engineer?top_ans=315749410,2021-10-23T13:12:49.672993+00:00,2021-10-23T13:45:29.193901+00:00,17,Raymond Pang,https://www.quora.com/profile/Raymond-Pang-2

Will AI decrease the demand for ML/AI engineers in the long term? Should i give up studying Computer Science?,"Oh, great! Another person thinking they can just give up studying Computer Science because AI is going to swoop in and steal all the jobs. Well, let me tell you something, my friend. AI may be advancing, but that doesn't mean you should throw in the towel just yet.

Sure, AI is making strides in various industries, and it's true that it can automate certain tasks that were previously done by humans. But that doesn't mean it's going to eliminate the need for ML/AI engineers altogether. In fact, it's quite the opposite.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, the demand for skilled ML/AI engineers is only going to increase. You see, AI doesn't magically create itself. It needs humans like you to design, develop, and maintain it. And let me tell you, that's not a job just anyone can do.

So, if you're thinking about giving up on Computer Science because you're scared of AI taking over, think again. The field of ML/AI is evolving rapidly, and there's a whole world of opportunities waiting for those who have the skills and knowledge to navigate it.

Sure, AI may change the landscape of certain job roles, but it also opens up new avenues and creates new possibilities. Instead of running away from it, embrace the challenge. Adapt, learn, and stay ahead of the game. That's how you secure your place in the future of technology.

So, my advice to you is this: don't be a quitter. Stick with Computer Science, dive deeper into ML/AI, and become a force to be reckoned with. The demand for ML/AI engineers isn't going anywhere, my friend. It's only going to grow. Now, get back to your studies and show the world what you're made of!

I took courses on them and was pretty much disappointed. Machine Learning turned out to be exactly what I thought it would be - data analysis and using some algorithm in top of it to figure out stuff.

I thought it would be more interesting. Machine Learning is a lot of math and statistics. Not sure how many people would find it as exciting as popular media shows it to be.

However, one course which really intrigued me was Cryptography and Network Security. We learned about Modern Cryptography, Cryptographic Protocols, Network Security, Web Security.

We literally “hacked” into websites and softwares exploiting various vulnerabilities. The course had a lab component too which made things even more interesting.

I feel that Cryptography and NetSec is a really underappreciated field in Computer Science - and it's importance is growing every year. I feel that in 5–10 years it will replace ML as the “hottest field out there”.

Studying various attacks and figuring out their remedies gives a detective/007 feel, and I'm not kidding.

What's the easiest way to learn machine learning?,"My recommendation is a little different from others answering this question; I assume you want to become a star at both Machine Learning AND Engineering.

Why do I draw the distinction? Well, there are lots of folks in the market that are great engineers and there are also lots of folks who are great at machine learning, but there is a severe shortage of great Machine Learning Engineers.

Engineers who are great in both fields are basically unicorns and are at least 10x as valuable as someone who is great in just one of the fields. These are the engineers who don’t just work on algorithms or systems all day but instead launch personalization products in the market. These are the types of engineers who are behind the personalization teams at companies such as Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn and many successful personalization startups
 
So, what do you do if you want to become one of these unicorns? (In no particular order)

1. Learn how to be a great engineer.  Learn multiple languages and get really good at them. Don’t just focus on a single language such as Python as many Machine Learning Engineers do. Instead, broaden your scope to include languages like Java, C++, Scala and JavaScript. This will allow you to join a team and and to hit the ground running with any company's systems you work with.
 
2. Learn how to build highly-scaled distributed systems.  Build systems that have a 50ms SLA and take hundreds or thousands of transactions per second. Ideally, systems that are critical for a business to run. Real-time event ingestion and recommendations systems are ideal.
 
3. Build your machine learning fundamentals by studying some material on the subject:
 * Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning lectures are a great start: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599 [ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599 ]

4. Play with some big datasets that are publicly available. Find a dataset that you find personally interesting or that you have theories about and see if you are correct!
 * US Government Data http://www.data.gov/

 * SF City Data http://datasf.org/  (I personally find local data easy to identify with)

 * Reddit/r/DataSets https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets


5. Take a role with a product-focused machine learning or personalization team.  The team you search for should be filled with engineers whom you think you can both teach and learn from. This will make you a much better machine-learning engineer. Also, by working on a product team you will quickly learn how the science and theory of machine learning differ from the practice.

Then you need to read on machine learning (there are several good books, such as Chris Bishop's and Kevin Murphy's, online videos such as Andrew Ng's coursera's class and Hugo Larochelle's videos on neural networks, and you can get a summary of many of the basic issues in chapter 5 of the Deep Learning book). Then you need to start practicing, i.e., programming some learning algorithms yourself and playing with them on data, try to compete in some Kaggle competitions, for example.  Try to become an expert at optimizing hyper-parameters and choosing models appropriately. In parallel, continue reading. If you are interested in deep learning, part 2 of my book will give you the basis for the most common algorithms.

How do I learn mathematics for machine learning?,"Great question! How indeed does one prepare oneself for a (research or otherwise) career in machine learning, in particular in terms of familiarizing oneself with the underlying mathematics? I’m going to resist the temptation of trotting out some standard books, and instead, focus on giving broad advice.

There’s some bad news on this front, and it’s best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible. Having spent 35+ years studying machine learning, let me put this in the most direct way possible: no matter how much time and effort you devote to it, you can never know enough math to read through all the ML literature. Different parts of ML use a variety of esoteric math. There’s just no way one person can know all of this math, so it’s good to be forewarned.

OK, with that out of the way, how does one prepare oneself? Think of the process analogous to conditioning your mind and body to run a marathon. It’s a gradual process, of improving your fitness, your ability to run for longer and longer distances, your breathing technique, your mental focus, and dozens of other dimensions. Working in ML is not like running a 100 meter sprint, where the race is pretty much over in a single breath. It’s much more of an endurance sport, where you have to constantly work at it to remain in shape, and there’s no point at which you can relax and say: OK, I know it all! Because no one does!

An example from my recent work will clarify the issues involved. One of the major challenges in machine learning is that there’s never enough training data to tackle every ML problem that presents itself. Humans are especially adept in solving this challenge. I can get on a flight from San Francisco and within a few short hours find myself in a dizzying diversity of new environments, from the glitzy subways of Tokyo and the bleak winter in Scandinavia to an arid savannah in Africa, or a swampy rainforest in Brazil. There’s no way I can ever hope to collect training samples from every possible environment that I can encounter in life. So, what do we do? We transfer our learned knowledge from places we’ve been — so, having taken the BART subway in San Francisco, and subways in New York and London, I can try to handle the complexity of the subway in Tokyo by drawing upon my previous experience. Of course, it doesn’t quite match — the language is completely different, the tone and texture of the visual experience is completely different (attendants in gloved hands show you the way in Tokyo — no such luxury is available in the US!). Yet, we somehow manage, and plod our way through new experiences. We even cherish the prospect of finding ourselves in some alien new culture, where we don’t speak the language and can’t ask for directions. It opens up our mind to new horizons, all part of the charm of travel.

So, what’s the mathematics involved in implementing a transfer learning algorithm? It varies a lot depending on what type of approach you investigate. Let’s review some approaches from computer vision over the past few years. One class of approaches are so-called subspace methods, where the training data from a collection of images in the “source” domain (which conveniently has labels given to us) is to be compared with a collection of unlabeled images from a “target” domain (e.g., “source” → NY subway, “target” → Tokyo subway).

One can take a collection of images of size NxN and using a variety of different methods find the smallest subspace that the source images lie in (treating each image as a vector in N^2 dimensions). Now, to understand this body of work, you obviously need to know some linear algebra. So, if you don’t understand linear algebra, or you took a class way back when and forgot it all, it’s time to refresh your memory or learn anew. Fortunately, there are excellent textbooks (Strang is usually a good place to start) and also something like MATLAB will let you explore linear algebraic ML methods without having to implement things like eigenvalue or singular value decomposition. As I usually told my students, keep the motto “eigen do it if I try” in mind. Persevere, and keep the focus on why you are learning this math. Because it is important and essential to understand much of modern ML.

OK, great, you’ve managed to learn some linear algebra. Are you done? Ummm, not quite. So, back to our transfer learning example. You construct a source subspace from the source images, and a target subspace from the target images. Umm, how does one do that. OK, you can use a garden variety dimensionality reduction method like principal components analysis (PCA), which just computes the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the source and target images. This is one subroutine call in MATLAB. But, PCA is 100 years old. How about something new and cool, like a ooh la la subspace tracking method like GOUDA, which uses the fancier math of Lie groups. Oops, now you need to learn some group theory, the mathematics of symmetry. As it turns out, matrices of certain types, like all invertible matrices, or all positive definite matrices, are not just linear algebraic objects, they are also of interest in group theory, a particularly important subfield of which is Lie groups (Lie → “Lee”).

OK, great, you have a smattering of knowledge of group theory and Lie groups. Are you done? Hmmm…actually not, because it turns out Lie groups are not just groups, but they are also continuous manifolds. What in the blazes is a “manifold”? If you google this, you are likely to encounter web pages describing engine parts! No, a manifold is something entirely different in machine learning, where it means a non-Euclidean space that has curvature. It turns out the set of all probability distributions (e.g., 1 dimensional Gaussians with a scalar variance dimension and a scalar mean dimension) are not Euclidean, but rather, describe a curved space. So, the set of all positive definite matrices form a Lie group, with a certain curvature. What this implies is that obvious operations like taking the average have to done with considerable care. So, off you go, learning all there is to know about manifolds, Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, exp and log mappings, etc. Oh, what fun!

Getting back to our transfer learning method, if you compute the source covariance matrix C_s and the target covariance matrix C_t, then there is a simple method called CORAL (for correlational alignment) that figures out how to transform C_s into C_t using some invertible mapping A. CORAL is popular as a transfer learning method in computer vision. But, CORAL does not actually use the knowledge that the space of positive definite matrices (or covariance matrices) forms a manifold. In fact, it forms something called a cone in convex analysis. If you subtract one covariance matrix from another, the result is not a covariance matrix. So, they do not form a vector space, but rather something else entirely. Oops, it turns out the study of cones is important in convex analysis, so there you go again, you need to learn about convex sets and functions, projections onto convex sets, etc. The dividing line between tractable and intractable optimization is not linear vs. nonlinear, but rather, convex vs. non-convex.

I hope the pattern is becoming clear. Like one of those legendary Russian dolls, where each time you open one, you find it is not the end, but there’s another one inside it, so it is with learning math in machine learning. Each time you learn a bit of math, you find it opens the door to an entirely new field of math, which you need to know something about as well. For my most recent paper, I had to digest a whole book devoted entirely to the topic of positive definite matrices (it’s like the old joke, where the deeper you go, the more you know about a specialized topic, until you know everything about —- nothing!).

Any given problem in machine learning, like transfer learning, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, as a manifold learning problem, as a multivariate statistical estimation problem, as a nonlinear gradient based deep learning problem, etc. etc. Each of these requires learning a bit about the underlying math involved.

If you feel discouraged, and feel like tearing your hair out at this point, I sympathize with you. But, on the other hand, you can look on the positive side, and realize that in terms of our analogy of running a marathon, you are steadily becoming better at running the long race, building your mathematical muscle as you go along, and gradually things start falling into place. Things start to make sense, and different subfields start connecting with each other. Something strange happens. You start liking it! Of course, there’s a drawback. Someone who doesn't understand any of the math you get good at using asks you to explain your work, and you realize that it’s impossible to do that without writing equations.

Most researchers find their comfort zone and try to stay within it, since otherwise, it takes a great deal of time and effort to master the dozens of mathematical subfields that modern ML uses. But, this strategy eventually fails, and one is always forced to get outside one’s comfort zone and learn some new math, since otherwise, a whole area of the field becomes alien to you.

Fortunately, the human brain is an amazing instrument, and provides decades and decades of trouble-free operation, allowing us to continually learn over 40,50, 60, years or more. How precisely it does that without zeroing out all prior learning is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science!",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=72758478,2018-02-10T22:34:01.177380+00:00,2018-02-13T10:03:28.965016+00:00,1302,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
"How should I start to learn machine learning from scratch, from the beginner to the advanced level?","Great answers here already:

The foundation of machine learning (ML) is maths and not data science. So start by polishing up your maths skills. ML currently is a very hot area with many more people trying to learn it but most don't understand that the underlying principles in machine learning are that of optimization theory in maths.

Thus to give you a boost revisit the prerequisites.

1. Maths:
2. 
1. Linear algebra: Make sure you are comfortable with matrices, vectors and singular value decomposition (SVD).
2. Calculus: Especially differential calculus, become comfortable with evaluation of derivatives of any function and learn chain rule.
3. Numerical optimization: Like I said above ML is currently more related to numerical optimization than anything else. Most optimization methods are variants of gradient descent such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). So learn about first order and second order optimization methods.
4. Statistics and probability: Bayes theorem, random variables, probability distribution functions such as the Binomial and Gaussian distributions. Sigmoid and softmax functions are motivated by probability.

3. Programming: In any of the following:
4. 
1. 
1. Python: Is an easy to learn scripted language that you can quickly pick up for the purpose of practicing what you are learning. Python has a lot of ML libraries supporting it thus it is ideal not only for beginners but also for experts.
2. Java: is a fairly high-level language that is fairly easy to learn but not as easy as Python. It also has a lot of ML libraries supporting it.
3. C/C++: Don't mess with this one at beginner level but start getting used to writing ML code from scratch as you advance so that you can learn more details about most ML algorithms. It is recommended to build your own mini-ML library at some point in your learning journey using such low-level high-performance languages.


With that said, there are several roadmaps to reaching your destination. I can split them up into three stages.

1. Beginner stage.
2. Intermediary stage.
3. Advanced (expert) stage.
Beginner stage:

The beginning part has been partially covered above, begin with maths. And if you are not good at maths you will need to make sure you are good. Thus make sure to sharpen the axe before starting to chop down the tree. Maths is very important for learning ML as most of the times, systems are expressed in mathematical terms. So before starting, please go through the basics. Don't worry about forgetting something along the way, you can always go back to revisit the stuff you have forgotten, this is not an exam.

This is where you also have to set yourself up for success in ML, so I suggest you skim through the basic concepts of ML and the book [1] by Ian Goodfellow and others is an excellent book to introduce you to ML and the current hot area in ML called deep learning (DL). Go through the book in any order you like but make sure to read the introduction first.

At beginner level is also the time to sharpen up another axe, programming. Practice coding on problems that are not even related to ML so that you can learn the syntax of that language. You can't learn coding by reading but through practice. Python being English-like is very easy to pick up and there are a lot of resources out there teaching Python coding. Just Google and you will find high quality tutorials on Python programming. In fact your best way to learn coding is to just jump directly to coding and just Google and Stackoverflow your way through learning the syntax of the language. Every modern programmer owes their project completions to Google and Stackoverflow, let no one lie to you, we are in an era of powerful “cheating” tools like Google search. Don't just copy and paste though, understand the solutions you find online and code your own versions afterwards. If you can't code a matrix operation in Python just Google and try to understand what others did. Sometimes very basic code can be just copied and pasted.

Also go through the TensorFlow (TF) tutorials as well. They will not only introduce you to TF but also to the concepts of ML such as linear and logistic regression.

Intermediary stage:

At this stage you should have already read several online sources such as articles, books and watched several YouTube videos on ML and you should have coded up some models at high-level using libraries like TF. Now it is time to start moving forward, you need to make sure that that knowledge does not slip away, you need to consolidate that knowledge in your mind.

This is where things start to get interesting because you need to now ask yourself, can I implement backpropagation algorithm from scratch? You will notice that you probably wouldn't, that's okay. You need at this point to start pursuing proofs like deriving mathematical expressions you find while reading ML literature. Try to derive backprop for simple neural networks yourself from your own perspective and understanding and see if you can translate that maths to actual working code. Try to also implement convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) from scratch.

This is where you start to build your mini-ML library. You will be able to learn a great deal of detail about ML this way. Implement stochastic gradient descent and train your own ML models using your own mini-ML library and debug until the models work comparable to those from mature libraries like TF. Open source the mini-ML library afterwards to further show off your skills to potential employers or for the purpose of getting into the Google Brain residency program for example.

You also need to start reading journal after journal at this point. At first it will be hard but with more reading and rereading you will start to understand even complex journals from the likes of DeepMind, OpenAI, Microsoft, Facebook and Google. If you start to understand journals it means you are advancing well towards your goal.

Advanced stage:

Yes coding your own mini-ML library is sort of like reinventing the wheel but it is essential for learning the details of the most important underlying concepts in machine learning but not sufficient to make you an expert. This advanced stage comes after spending a few years in the intermediary stage.

In the advanced stage you need to start paying attention to your own intuitions and ideas. Build or start working on actual novel ML algorithms. You will need to empirically or theoretically validate your ideas by implementing them and doing lots of experiments. It is somewhat hard to design a novel ML algorithm as the ideas come, in form of a eureka moment, after years or months of thinking and lots of research work.

This is why being at an advanced level requires that you have built up a strong mental model of the field of ML from a variety of angles. You don't have to be an expert programmer though, as the coding skills only need to help you implement your models.

At this stage start asking and pursuing deep questions to which there are no answers yet. Focus on areas that are counterintuitive and try to come up with more novel intuitive solutions to those areas. It is like a PhD program.


That is a possible roadmap for someone trying to learn ML. It is also important to practice by explaining complex ML systems to someone else. Quora is a great place for answering ML related questions, that way you will be able to consolidate your knowledge when explaining the ML algorithms to others, it's a win-win situation, you help others while you gain and consolidate knowledge yourself.

The other thing worth noting is that you really need to be passionate about the ML field otherwise it won’t be easy. You also need to have tenacity because some concepts take long to understand fully, you may think that you get a concept up until it's time to implement it yourself. Thus learning ML especially by yourself requires serious discipline and focus. You can only maintain that focus if you are passionate and determined to learn ML.

With that said the journey itself is quite fun, fulfilling and challenging, not hard but challenging just keep going and read anything that interests you concerning ML.

Be passionately curious, you will get there.

Hope this helps.

"I want to make my career in machine learning. How do I start? What should I learn, and where?","I work in Data Science / Machine Learning based software products team. My team comprises of Machine Learning engineers, Data Scientists and Data Engineers.

People have made switch from QA to Data Engineer. Developer to Data Scientist. I have given almost 2 years in understanding Machine learning / Data science.

Here’s my take

as Mike West [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-West-99 ] mentioned there’s no easy way. Below are some Dos and Don’ts

1. If you are starting from scratch work on basics first.
2. 
1. Statistics.(Descriptive and Inferential ) Khan academy has amazing videos
2. Probability. Again Khan academy
3. Matrix operations and manipulation
4. Basic Linear Algebra. It will help you visualize things in 3D plane.

3. A programming language. Python is your best bet. Learn various data manipulation and statistical libraries.
4. Learn SQL . Most of your time as ML/ DS person will be spend in querying the data source.
5. Start with some basic algorithms Linear Regression and understand end to end.
6. Get some publicly available data and play with that. Understand the data. Try to see patterns. Apply visualizations for better understanding.
7. Then eventually learn more complex Algorithms.
8. Look at kaggle at other persons solutions to learn more. But frankly dont take it too seriously as real life problems are way more abstract than Kaggle problems. Use kaggle to build your portfolio.
9. Refer some good books.
10. 
1. Introduction to Statistical Learning  [ http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ ]: Excellent book to start with.
2. Buy Pandas for Everyone: Python Data Analysis, 1e Book Online at Low Prices in India [ https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/9352869168/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ]
3. Buy Machine Learning Book Online at Low Prices in India [ https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1259096955/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ]
4. Deep Learning classics like Deep Learning [ https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ ]

11. Eventually read ML papers and try to implement them.
12. If possible get a full time degree. With so many people doing 1 week to 6 months online course , it will be very difficult for you to separate yourself from the crowd.
Dont’s :

1. Don’t fall for boot camps which promises to make you ML engineer in 6 months or 3 months. if its that easy then why companies pay you higher salaries. There’s no magic bullet.
2. Don’t get overwhelmed by so much information available. Start small and basic. Keep on increasing complexity
3. Don’t rush to implement algorithms to data set. Understand each properly, their use case .
4. Try to avoid costly online courses.
Below are the courses I did:

1. 1 year PGD in Data Science from IIM Kolkata .(not recommended) (cost almost 3.5 lakh in 2018)
2. couple of MOOC from Udemy. (too shallow)
3. Applied Course [ https://www.appliedaicourse.com/ ] : Excellent course structure. (cost 25k in 2019) . I wish I could have done it as first thing. The certification may not value much but knowledge you will get will be immense.
I hope this helps.

What should I know before trying to learn machine learning?,"It’s an ocean.

There’s a lot out there.

You’ll read articles telling you to code first others telling you to learn math first others telling you should learn Python instead of R.

Some of mine do.

The real answer is to remind yourself, learning anything takes time.

And learning by definition is hard.

I started learning machine learning two-years ago. I studied in my room Monday to Friday and drove Uber on the weekends to pay for studies.

There were times I didn’t feel like studying. Woke up, laid there, stared at the ceiling thought about what I had to do, didn’t feel like it. Every cell did not feel like studying.

I asked myself.

One question.

Three words.

What’s the alternative?

I knew the answer.

The alternative to studying was not studying. Not learning machine learning. I already knew the outcome.

So I sat down.

Dove into the ocean of machine learning.

Reminded myself I can never control the waves.

But I can learn to surf.

",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=153823753,2019-07-13T10:49:15.207707+00:00,,312,Daniel Bourke,https://www.quora.com/profile/Daniel-Bourke-2
What math do you need to know to learn machine learning?,"As others mentioned before, it will mostly boil down to Statistics and Linear Algebra. However, I am very surprised how vague answers are.

There are lots of different techniques that you can specialise in so I’ll try mentioning some places where you can start. Hopefully, it will make you realise, that there is a lot to cover and how you can start doing that.

Linear Algebra

Topics:

 * Vectors & Matrices
 * Matrix Multiplication & Transformations
 * Eigenvector analysis
 * Linear Equation Systems
Good place to learn:

 * Precalculus | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/ ]
 * Linear Algebra | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra ]
 * Linear Algebra [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm ]
 * http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf
Calculus

Basically, you need to be able to do derivative and integration inside out.

Topics:

 * Differentiation
 * Chain Rule
 * Partial Derivatives
 * Integrals
Good places to learn:

 * AP Calculus AB | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab ]
 * Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus ]
Statistics

Probably, the most important thing is to have a pretty decent grasp on probability density and mass functions (PDFs and PMFs) for most of the common distributions (like Gaussian, Binomial, or Exponential family).

In the end, if you know statistics really well, you can make any machine learning problem into a statistics problem. I would even claim, that the current machine learning developments (apart from deep learning) are just rediscovery of statistics with the computation power of modern computers.

Also, I will skip things like expected value, variance, and etc. because that’s basics.

Topics:

 * Distributions and their CDFs and PDFs:
 * 
 * Binomial
 * Poisson
 * Exponential family
 * 
 * Gaussian distribution in particular


 * Calculating CDFs from PDFs
 * Bayes Rule
 * Naive Bayes
 * Markov Chains
 * Belief Networks (or Graphical Models in General)
Good places to learn:

 * Statistics and probability [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability ]
 * Probability | Statistics and probability | Math | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library ]
 * Journey into information theory [ https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory ]
 * http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf
Optimisation

And finally optimisation. I would say it’s just a part of Calculus (and it would look like that Khan agrees) but whatever. Here you want to be able to find the minimum or either the maximum of some function.

Topics:

 * Gradient Descend
 * Stochastic (Online) Gradient Descend
 * Expectation Maximization
Good places to learn:

 * Derivative applications [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/derivative-applications-calc ]
 * Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] (note: it seems that Andrew Ng is in love with gradient descend so it is covered there pretty well)
What’s next?

There is a lot of material online for machine learning online but the problem with it is that most of it is very shallow and, honestly, it isn’t worth your time.

However, I would go with the following courses:

Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] - A great introductory course to Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. It will cover some statistics and fair amount of linear algebra. Additionally, it exposes you to some decent optimisation basics.

Probabilistic Graphical Models | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models ] - Pretty tough course by Daphne Koller. You might also want to check out a book, that the course is based on Probabilistic Graphical Models [ http://pgm.stanford.edu/ ] . The course will give you some decent intro to Bayesian Probabilistic Models.

Neural Networks for Machine Learning - University of Toronto | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks ] - Neural Nets by Jeff Hinton. If this course is anything as it was before, take it only if you are really interested in neural nets. It makes you do some proper maths, to realise how do those nets actually work. I wouldn’t take it as a beginner.

However, that course doesn’t cover some newer development in DeepNets so you might want to see CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing [ http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html ] or CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition [ http://cs231n.github.io ] to cover things like RNNs and LSTMs.

A quick peek

What it would take you to solve these?

1. Solve [math]Xw=b [/math] for w where X is data matrix and w is a weight vector and b is a target value (constant).
2. Calculate Kullback-Leibler divergence between [math]p(x)=N(x|\mu,\sigma^2) [/math]and [math]q(x)=N(x|m,s^2)[/math].
3. Prove [math]p(x,y|z) = p(x|z)p(y|x,z) [/math]
Given all of this, you should be good enough to know where to go next.

Good Luck

I am pretty sure I’ve missed some important stuff but I am also sure that this will set you on the right track.

Good luck!",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=43746855,2017-05-06T18:05:54.717458+00:00,2017-05-07T09:16:19.835468+00:00,111,Tadas Šubonis,https://www.quora.com/profile/Tadas-Šubonis
What is the usual way to start learning Machine learning?,"The usual way is to sign up for a bunch of online courses, breeze through some of the videos while skipping the coding assignments and then spending the next few months procrastinating and wondering which deep learning library is better out of TensorFlow, Theano, Torch, Keras and CNTK.

The best way is to start doing stuff right away. Install Python or R or some other programming language that does machine learning well and start coding. Don’t worry too much about which language or tool is better. Get some data or even generate some random data yourself and implement basic stuff like linear regression and gradient descent. Google how to do stuff. Some of the simpler algorithms can be understood just by reading their Wikipedia pages. If you like what you’re doing, you can sign up for Coursera’s Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng to get an introduction to the concepts and math behind ML. If you know the basics and can successfully implement 3–5 algorithms you are already way ahead of most beginners.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=32436556,2016-12-14T14:52:15.851082+00:00,2016-12-14T14:53:15.239961+00:00,282,Håkon Hapnes Strand,https://www.quora.com/profile/Håkon-Hapnes-Strand
How does a total beginner start to learn machine learning if they have some knowledge of programming languages?,"Awesome questions! Machine learning is a great field to get into; not only is it highly sought after by employers, it also helps you understand the world in a new way.

Most machine learning algorithms are based heavily in math, and are made possible by programming. Here are the basic things I would suggest picking up as you tackle machine learning:

1. Matrix Algebra: Matrix algebra is really important when you start working with large amounts of data; here’s a good online matrix algebra class from MIT: Linear Algebra [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/ ]
2. Statistics: It’s been argued that machine learning is really just computer aided statistics. I’m not sure if I totally agree with that, but having a basis in statistics will help you wrap your head around a lot of the simpler learning algorithms (i.e. regression). I haven’t taken this course specifically, but I’ve heard good things about Udacity’s statistics offering: Elementary Statistics Course Online [ https://www.udacity.com/course/statistics--st095 ]
3. Calculus: I know, now it sounds like I’m just listing off every math class I know—like I said, machine learning is math-heavy. You don’t need that much calculus, but having a basic grasp of what a derivative is will be really helpful. This page is pretty simple, but if you can get through it and fell like you understand what’s going on, you’re in good shape (at least to start): The Definition of the Derivative [ http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/diff/der00/der00.html ]
4. Programming: Of course you’ll have to program in order to actually implement learning algorithms, and it’s good to know a general purpose programming language. You said you have experience with Java and Python and those are great. If you didn’t I would recommend picking up Python through CodeCademy: Python [ https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python ]
5. MatLab: It’s important to know how to program in general, but it’s also really helpful to be familiar with MatLab; you can effectively study machine learning in another language (i.e. Python) but so many of the resources for beginners use MatLab. If you are in college you can probably get MatLab for free through your institution. If not, I would suggest trying out Octave; it’s fairly similar to MatLab, and its free.
6. Basic Learning Algorithms: Finally to the fun stuff. To get a feel for the basics I would strongly suggest you check out Andrew Ng’s Coursera course on machine learning. It’s well made, and very accessible. In it he draws on all the things in this list; although he briefly introduces each of these subjects, it’ll be a lot easier if you have a foundation in all of them before tackling machine learning: Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/ ]
If you can make your way through this list, by the end you should at least be familiar with the field of machine learning, and be prepared to figure out what you want to learn next. Good luck!",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=28288622,2016-09-24T14:12:19.336898+00:00,,256,William Lifferth,https://www.quora.com/profile/William-Lifferth
How do I learn machine learning?,"Machine Learning is among the most popular and rapidly evolving technologies. It is a field with a wide range of employment prospects. There are several alternatives available to you if you want to get the necessary abilities and begin a career in the field of Machine Learning. There are several colleges on the market that provide Machine Learning courses from where you can simply launch your career. I would suggest Learnbay Institute and Simplilearn Institute among the plethora of institutes since they give the greatest training program and employment help program.

The following are the five most essential subjects in machine learning that you should be familiar with:

1. Probability
It aids in forecasting the likelihood of occurrences as well as determining if a scenario mayor cannot occur again. The cornerstone of machine learning is said to be a probability.

2. Calculus

The topic of calculus is significant in the realm of mathematics, and it is used in a variety of ML methods. Data sets with numerous characteristics are utilized to develop ML models since multiple multivariable calculus is necessary for creating an ML model. Differentiation and integration are two of the most crucial calculus subjects to master.

3. Linear Algebra

It is concerned with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It is one of the most significant requirements for studying ML since it can be used to modify and operate on datasets.

4. Statistics

It comprises tools that are used to extract results from data. Descriptive statistics are a type of statistics that aid in the transformation of raw data into useful information. Another type of statistics is inferential statistics, which is used to extract essential information from a sample of data using a whole dataset.

5. Programming

If we really want to implement the entire Machine Learning process, we must know at least one computer language, such as R or Python. Both of the aforementioned programming languages include built-in libraries that make it relatively simple to construct Machine Learning algorithms.

If you want to begin studying the aforementioned machine learning principles, there are a few things you need to do:

Recognizing the Prerequisites:

 * Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Statistics, and Python are all prerequisites. You don't need a Ph.D. in these areas to get started, but you do need a basic understanding.
 * Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus are both required for Machine Learning.
 * Statistics is a field of mathematics concerned with data collection, analysis, and presentation. As a result, it is unsurprising that you will need to study it. Furthermore, there is one thing you must not overlook: Python.
Instructor-led instruction:

 * If you want to switch jobs in machine learning and have both long-term and quick professional advancement, you can learn machine learning through instructor-led courses.
Understanding Various ML Concepts:

 * Model, Feature, Target (Label), Training, and Prediction are some of the core ideas in ML. Machine learning may be classified into four types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
 * You must also investigate several theories and conduct experiments on real-world datasets. This will help you build intuition about which kind of models are appropriate in certain circumstances.
 * Along with these processes, it is critical to understand how to analyze the data obtained by using various models. This is easier to do if you're familiar with the various tuning settings and regularisation methods used on different models.
Categorization:

 * It aids in the prediction of discrete variables or a class of data.
 * It involves determining if a person has an illness, whether an email is a spam, whether a transaction is valid or fraudulent, and so forth.
Take part in projects:

 * After you've mastered the foundations of Machine Learning, you may go on to the interesting and entertaining portion. PROJECTS! These will effectively improve your ML skills by combining your most theoretical understanding with the actual application.
 * These initiatives will also assist you in your career search in this sector.
If you succeed in this Machine Learning sector, you will have a few prospective Machine Learning job options to choose from, such as:

 * ML Engineer

How much should I go into mathematical concepts in machine learning?,"I will try to keep this as concise as possible.

Edit: Somebody merged the original question to this question, so the premise becomes irrelevant.

To become a full stack AI/ML engineer, it is imperative that you have a complete grasp of the mathematical foundations of ML so that you can build upon concepts easily. The basic mathematical skills required are Linear Algebra, Matrix Algebra, Probability and some basic Calculus.

Linear Algebra

The best source to study Linear Algebra is Prof. Gilbert Strang’s Linear Algebra book/course. Video Lectures | Linear Algebra | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/ ] (MIT OCW). There are 34 lectures and believe me, they are completely worth it as after completing this, linear algebra should not pose any more problems for you. Solve some exercises/exams if you want to achieve mastery (recommended).

Matrix Algebra

Matrix algebra is an essential component of deep learning. I personally recommend this (Matrix Cookbook by Kaare Brandt Petersen & Michael Syskind Pedersen): http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf (PDF). There are 66 pages of pure matrix operations and this is the absolute “go-to” in case you are stuck trying to understand certain matrix manipulations that a researcher might have done.

Probability & Statistics

Understanding probability is a very important aspect of understanding ML. Some of the key probability concepts that you must be aware of include Bayes’ Theorem, distributions, MLE, regression, inference and so on. The best resource for this is Think Stats (Exploratory Data Analysis in Python) by Allen Downey: http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf (PDF). This absolute gem of a book is 264 pages long and covers all the aspects of probability and statistics that you need to understand with relevant Python code.

Optimization

The go-to book for Convex Optimization is Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe: https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf (PDF). This is a 730 page book and you need not read it all in one go. Choose the concept which you need to learn depending on your requirements and interest and read that part. It is complete and extremely well written. This book is free as part of the CVX 101 MOOC on EdX.

This 263 page book on metaheuristics, Essentials of Metaheuristics by Sean Luke (http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf (PDF)) talks about gradient based optimization, policy optimization etc. and it is well written. One can choose to go through this also if interested.

Data science concepts are covered in the above topics. Other topics can be learnt by googling for sources easily as and when you encounter them. But complete understanding of the above should suffice for 95% of all scenarios.


Achieving mastery of the above topics will surely make you a mathematically strong AI/ML engineer. Now that you have built the foundation, start dipping your feet into research papers. They are absolutely essential as these clearly show the standards of AI researchers/engineers. Firstly, find out the famous papers of AI like RNN, LSTM, SVM etc. and go through the technical content.

Can you understand the jargon?

Can you understand the mathematics?

Can you implement the mathematics in code now without the help of overly sufficient libraries?

These are the key questions to be answered. Once you can answer “Yes/Mostly Yes” to these 3 questions, you are good to go.

After trying to read these papers dealing with the most popular concepts, try to read the not-so-famous papers. arXiv is a great site with hundreds of preprints being published everyday by top researchers and reading the papers from here is like drinking straight out of the fire-hose. Try to choose a paper which looks fairly well written and the abstract seems interesting. Then, read that paper and try to answer those 3 questions again. The same can be done with papers of top AI conferences like NIPS, AAAI, AAMAS, IJCAI, ICML etc. You may not be able to fully implement the papers due to data constraints and other issues, but if you are able to understand even 60% of the mathematical reasoning, then I can safely say you have completed your training.

Do not concentrate on learning more and more “packages”. Concentrate on the concept. While implementing, you will automatically see that you require “this” package and then you will automatically learn to use it. Learning the various commands of random packages won’t help. If you start implementing and writing codes to solve problems or simulate results from a paper, you will automatically learn about packages and use them appropriately; they’ll be the least of your concerns. This is the correct way to maintain “balance” between math and coding. You can also participate in competitions (e.g. Kaggle or conference competitions) to improve speed, development and processing skills if you feel the need to do so.

How can I learn machine learning by myself?,"My way to learn ML in chronological order:

1. Motivate yourself. Why you have to learn ML? If you are doing image recognition, have you used other algorithms that doesn’t use ML? If you can’t achieve performance with that algorithm, then you can try ML. In robotics field, the other algorithms that doesn’t use Deep Learning had poor performance. That’s why I decided to learn ML & Deep Learning.
2. Learn Linear Algebra, calculus, and statistics. In most of the cases, you can solve problems only with these theory.
3. Go to Andrew Ng’s ML coursera course. Now you can implement machine learning program and choose algorithm by yourself.
4. Go to Geoffrey Hinton, or Andrew Ng’s Neural Network/Deep Learning course. Now you can understand the trend technology of machine learning.
5. Learn Deep Learning Software Frameworks. Deep Learning Software Framework can also implement shallow machine learning algorithms.
6. Learn Probabilistic Graphical Models. You have almost accomplished all fields of machine learning.
7. Read Arxiv papers of machine learning and get to the state-of-arts. Implement your own machine learning algorithm. Read many medium articles about ML.

Is machine learning really difficult?,"No. I wrote my first ML program waaay back in 1982, before there was Internet, Google, GPU computing, laptops, cellphones, digital cameras, desktop PCs, heck before there was almost anything remotely resembling what you see in the tech world around you today.

How did I even discover the existence of such a field? Back then, to educate oneself, you read books. Of course, you had to either go to a library, or in my case, a quaint event called a book fair. I attended a large book fair in New Delhi, India’s capital, and picked up this 800 page tome, a fairly massive affair. Why, I don’t know. After all, I was at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, studying to become an electrical engineer.

Hofstadter’s first book, and in my opinion, still his best, was an utter revelation to me. It opened up a whole new world of imagination of what deep links there are between art, music and abstract math, realized by the three central characters — Johann Sebastian Bach, Maurice Escher, Kurt Gödel — and computing, including of course AI and ML.

The book featured an intriguing set of visual puzzles from a Russian researcher named Bongard, where the task is to discover a rule that separates the six figures on the left from those on the right. This is an elementary problem in ML called classification. It’s analogous to distinguishing email from spam or deciding if an image contains a face. As humans, we classify sensory stimuli billions of times through our lives, and our very survival depends on it. As you cross the road, is the object approaching you a person or a Fedex truck? Get the answer wrong and your life may indeed be over. Not surprisingly, we solve such problems amazingly well.

I’ll leave you to work this one out, but with absolutely no training in this field, I nonetheless decided to foolishly make this the core of my Masters thesis project. Somehow I plodded through and worked out a solution, however naively it seems in retrospect. That experience made me realize that AI and ML was my life’s goal, and I decided to come to the United States in 1983, where I was incredibly fortunate to work with this brilliant Stanford educated researcher, Thomas Mitchell, now the Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

From Tom, I learned the most important lesson of all, which no book can teach you. Research is *fun*. He simply embodied the spirit of a researcher who bubbled with enthusiasm for the field of ML. He worked harder than anyone I had met, yet seemed to be having a ball. That lesson made a huge imprint on me and stayed with me ever since.

After getting my PhD, I joined IBM Watson Research in New York in late 1989, where they couldn’t figure out what to do with an ML researcher. So they threw me into a newly formed robotics group, even though I had absolutely no background in this field. I had never ever programmed a robot. Amazingly enough, I seemed to thrive in this somewhat challenging situation, and ended up writing some of my most highly cited papers, exploring how robots can acquire new behaviors using the newly emerging field of reinforcement learning. I also published in 1993 perhaps the first book on robot learning, which featured research from all over the world in this new area of AI. Despite having no background in robotics, I still managed to make a name for myself.

Many years later, I was elected a Fellow of AAAI, the leading international professional society for AI researchers. Each year, a small handful of researchers are selected and the competition is fierce. This year’s AAAI Fellows include some of the founders of the deep learning revolution: Yoshua Bengio, and Yann Le Cun.

The list of AAAI Fellows include some of the most amazing researchers in AI and ML, and I’m humbled to be listed in such distinguished company. None of this would have happened if back in 1982, I thought doing ML with no formal training in this field, with primitive computing, or doing robot learning at IBM in 1990 with no training in robotics, was “difficult”.

For those aspiring young researchers reading this on Quora, the best advice I can give you is that nothing is “difficult” if you set yourself the challenge of working on it. Above all, remember: research is fun! It’s an exploration into the unknown.

For many years, from 2001–2018, I was privileged to co-direct the Autonomous Learning Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, with one of reinforcement learning’s true pioneers, Andrew Barto. Andy and his former PhD student, Rich Sutton, helped establish the modern field of RL, the area that gave rise to Deep Mind and Alpha Go Zero. Andy and Rich embodied the true spirit of researchers having fun and working with them was the best professional experience of my career.

PhD students at the lab hung up a sign on the main door that was a quote from one of the most distinguished scientists of all time, Albert Einstein.

That sums it all. Research doesn’t need expertise. Einstein in fact hated textbook knowledge. Above all, he prized imagination, the ability to dream. If you want to make your children smart, he told parents, teach them fairy stories.

As we battle the latest pandemic, the Wuhan coronavirus, the biggest weapon at our disposal is our ability to sequence its genome. The biggest breakthrough in biology of the 20th century came from Watson and Crick, two brash biologists who upturned the world of biology by having fun! Watson went on to write a highly popular account of their discovery called the Double Helix. In it he tells the story of how they scandalized established researchers, like Oswald Avery of Columbia University, when he realized they didn’t know elementary biochemistry. Yet, by playing with 3D models and in effect stealing from Rosalind Franklin’s carefully gathered data sets, they cracked the secret of life. They were simply having fun!

So, again, my answer is, no, ML is not difficult. It is fun!",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=194849445,2020-01-29T01:15:51.169192+00:00,2020-11-28T16:39:32.936709+00:00,1174,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
How do I learn machine learning?,"One will come across these words like Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, these terms are some of the fields that are gaining quite a lot of attention. It is easy to start learning and getting trained in Machine Learning.

The first and foremost thing that you have to do is to find a platform that will give you insights into getting trained in Machine Learning and before you start with Machine Learning, there are few prerequisites like you should be aware of a programming language and should know the basics in statistics.

If you aren't aware of the prerequisites then look for a training platform that provides you the same. Machine Learning is an important part of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. So, you can opt for any of the platforms that provide training in either of these. After learning the concepts in Machine Learning, you can start working on projects as this will give you a better and clear understanding of the whole learning.

Concepts that you should cover under Machine Learning:

 * Supervised Learning
 * Linear Regression
 * Logistic Regression
 * Decision Trees
 * Unsupervised Learning
 * Natural Language Processing
 * Introduction to Time Series Forecasting
 * ARIMA and Multivariate Time Series Analysis
These are the concepts that you will have to cover if you are opting for a Machine Learning in Data Science program.

You can find various platforms that offer training in Machine Learning, but the one that I did like to recommend is Learnbay. Learnbay has designed Data Science and AI Programs for working professionals and these programs are certified by IBM. Under each program, there are various real-time projects that you can work on and can get hands-on experience. The sessions are held online. You can visit their website and get to know about the different programs that they have and offer.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=227899847,2020-07-16T13:03:04.324612+00:00,,180,Sakshi Sharma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sakshi-Sharma-3684
How do I begin a career in Machine Learning in India? What are prospects of ML in India? Which OSS are better to work on to gain a good experience in ML?,"Hi there,

First of all welcome to the world of data science. I would share my experience when I was at your stage. First will talk about the mistakes and then, how to fix them.

a. If you are at a stage where your just completed few tutorials in R programming, or data science courses in in Udemy or Coursera, stop before you feel like let's participate in Kaggle or other such competitions. Mistake 1. Kaggle competition in most cases doesn't teach you data science. Yes it does tell ""it's home for data science, but it's not a good host"", just kidding.

b. Do not tell yourself that if you know how to apply logistic regression, or PCA or K-means clustering et.al [ http://et.al ]. machine learning (ML) algorithms, you will become Data Scientist. No. Stop. Mistake 2.

C. Not trying to ask questions(high level, theoretical and oriented towards business problem and how doing data science would bring answers to those questions. If you are not starting from this way, guess what, you are doing mistake 3. and we can go on with this list.

Now, let's fix them.

a. Yes, you definitely need a tool to experiment, you can pick R which is fine. Others pick Python or Clojure or Weka etc, and some still use Java and Javascript. It depends. So, make sure you are comfortable with R functions such as lapply, tapply, mapply, sapply, as you are going to need them daily. You also practice how to read data from thousand of files sequentially, or from SQL database or from CSVs and try some NoSQL databases. This is totally ""not data science"". This is just an exercise to use R (any tool you pick) tool for data ingestion, processing and make them ready for your analysis. I initially started with Python, and after two years too R and just in a month I fell in love with R programming. I now prefer to use R.

b. Start reading a book which teaches you Statistics using R (again pick any tool you like). Why, because even before you get to apply those fancy ML algos, you will need to understand what your data represents, how are they distributed, how do they relate to each other, do they have missing values, how do you find or evaluate whether those variables are of any use to you, should you remove them or if you remove them are you going to lose any information, etc. You will get even more questions. So statistics. Very important. Still ""no data science.""

C. Once you have basic understanding of R(or any tool) and Statistics, pick the most simple machine learning algorithm i.e. “Linear Regression”. Read it first from statistical point of view, and then how to apply in R and why and when would you use Linear Regression. This will give your first glimpse of how to apply a ML algo to a data set. Then add one more algorithm, may be logistic regression, and so on. Do not rush, as you would need to make sure you very well know what are the strong and weak points of your algorithm. This is still ""not data science""

D. Once you have reached this stage. Pick a case study. Now this could be scary, but its ok. Here you immediately notice mix of statistics, ML algos, programming and function been built to several things. Just stick to it, and cover one topic or section at a time.

You will find tons of case studies online. I would suggest pick a case study on Fraud detection or recommendation systems. This is an area, which every industry has a problem with in this digital world.

Now comes, data science. Say you work for an eCommerce company and your colleague or managers asks you, can you detect fraudulent transactions from the entire transaction history and would you be able to predict it, given that historical transactions are already reviewed by ""domain experts"" and termed them either fraud transaction or non fraud. Well in real world, not all data would be clearly termed. Now, given such a scenario, you would need to do data processing first format the data in such a way that you ML algo understand, in the processing stage you do not want to lose any useful information so you have put extra measure, manual analysis and data analysis utilizing your statistics knowledge, work experience, domain experience etc. Hence you would spend 80% of your time cleaning the data and preparing them. Rest 20% would be to apply ML and deploying the solution.

After all of these, if you can answer the question above based on the data, which could save your company/clients/customers millions of dollars from the fraudulent transactions or getting new clients based on the products you have recommended, that's when you have applied all your knowledge and expertise to do data science.

I thought this might help you see what to expect from this path. Hope this answers your question.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=33425427,2016-12-30T11:42:46.921024+00:00,2018-10-12T15:59:08.419906+00:00,590,Bikash Debnath,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bikash-Debnath
How can I start learning machine learning from scratch?,"Hii Smruti Ranjan Senapati [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Smruti-Ranjan-Senapati ]

Before answering this question, let me ask you one question, how strong your algorithmic knowledge? I mean If someone asks you to create your own algorithm, are you able to create that?

What I am trying to convey is, Start from basics, Don’t go for the most advanced concept of nowadays. Machine learning is just sounds so easy, but its not. Machine learning, also can be noted as a main Child field of Artificial intelligence, and As sub part / field of machine learning there are number of topics like Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Statistics, Predictive Analytics, almost everything, including Data Science.

What it needs? Strong fundamentals of Algorithms, Programming (Recommended : Python, Matlab, R) and Solid Back ground of Data Mining.

Understand the term Machine Learning, Machine is Learning from the given training data to Machine. So very next time, the same query / question is repeated, machine must be able to answer it by self, by learning that term.! :)

You will find number of Online Courses like Machine Learning [ http://cs229.stanford.edu/ ] and Youtube channel of sentdex [ https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex ] or You can also try to explore course of Andrew Ng Machine Learning | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ]

Can I learn machine learning in 1 week?,"Generally, the answer to any question of the form “Can I learn X (some topic) with Y effort (time duration)” hinges on what you mean by “learn”. Therein lies the rub, as the saying goes. Certainly, by some definitions of the term “learn”, you can certainly “learn” ML in a week, in fact you can learn something about ML in a day! Heck, you can learn something about ML in an hour!!

For example, I just read a fascinating article on the fierce Komodo dragons, which are the largest predatory lizards on the planet. They can grow up to hundreds of pounds, and have incredibly sharp teeth. But, that’s not the scary part. The scary part is that a single (teensy weensy) bite from a Komodo is enough to bring down a fully grown bison, because evolution has engineered in the Komodo dragon a powerful set of anticoagulants. Once bitten, however minor the bite, the prey will essentially bleed out to death.

So, how did the Komodo dragon develop this fierce capability, along with the ability to hunt its prey over many miles of distance due to a phenomenal sense of smell. Groundbreaking research into their genetics has revealed a large set of mutations in about 200 of their 18000 genes, including changes to the mitochondria, which enables them to chase down their prey at terrifying speeds once they get close. I learned all this in about 20 minutes of reading the following NY Times article this afternoon:

Genome Study Reveals Clues to Komodo Dragon’s Unique Abilities [ https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/science/komodo-dragon-genome.html?action=click&module=Discovery&pgtype=Homepage ]

Now, this little bit of reading does not, of course, make me a world’s expert on Komodo dragons, any more than your spending a week learning ML will qualify you to do more than engage in polite after dinner conversation on how ML is used in certain applications (e.g., self-driving cars). But, if all you are after is gaining enough competency to engage in a little bit of chit chat about a hot technology, a week is plenty.

For example, block chain is currently another hot technology, and all my knowledge of block chain comes from reading snippets here and there, probably all told less than a week’s worth of time. Yes, I know a smattering of ideas related to block chain (e.g., it uses a distributed ledger), but other than nodding my head during a technical presentation on block chain, I can’t say I have any deep understanding of the core ideas.

In terms of machine learning, I have been studying it for almost 40 years! I wrote my first ML program in 1982, as a young student fascinated by this amazing futuristic software concept, all but sure that, while it made me stay up night after night writing my first ML program in Lisp on a huge clunky Digital Equipment Corporation DEC-10 computer in a cavernous computer room at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, it would largely be a harmless source of fun, and I’d have to get serious employment doing something far more boring, but much more useful. Little did I realize then that I would end up spending my whole professional life in the field, and that it would lead to being *very* well compensated.

So, after almost 40 years, have I “learned” ML finally? Alas, no. I still feel like I have much more to learn, and that this is a field that has infinite depth. However, the field has progressed so much in the 37 years I have spent studying it (my first professional ML meeting in 1985 had 50 attendees, and recent NeurIPS conferences have had more than 10,000 participants!) that I am slowly but surely shifting my focus to other topics in AI that are equally important, but far less well understood.

Machine learning is all about gaining insights from data, from history, from the past, and is incredibly useful if the future looks like the past. That works in a lot of practical problems, and over a reasonably short duration (e.g, a few seconds to a few years). It works much less well over a long duration, and it certainly does not work at all well in cases when there is no data about the phenomena you want to reason about.

You may ask: how can we possibly think about problems for which we have *no* data? In fact, that is *exactly* what distinguishes human imagination and creativity from machine learning. Every major advance in science and technology, from painting and arts, from music to poetry and beyond, is based not on data science by itself, but by imagining a future that does not exist.

Einstein was a great believer in imagination, and he considered it far more important than knowledge (which he said limits you to what we know today). He asked an almost childlike question: “If I travel at the speed of light, and hold out in front of me a mirror, will I see my reflection?”. What a beautiful example of imagination! This is not a data science experiment, and chances are, we cannot ever conduct such an experiment (not literally anyway). But it didn’t stop Einstein from using this “gedankenexperiment”, and many others like it, to develop his special, and later general, theories of relativity.

So, I am now focusing on the regime where data is of not much help (like if Tesla succeeded in selling a million self-driving cars in the Bay Area, and they are all running autonomously, how will that impact traffic?). My current focus is on understanding this mysterious thing called imagination, which to me is one of the most elegant things that humans do, and which runs their lives from early childhood to death. Yet, we understand it very poorly, and to me, at present, this is far more fascinating a topic than machine learning. The latter I leave to the tens of thousands who flock to meetings like NeurIPS.

Like the immortal biography of Richard Feynman by Jagdish Mehra, I choose “to hear the beat of a different drum”. I did that in 1982, when I started to study ML when almost no one in India was interested in this field, in 1990 when I started to develop a framework for robot learning around reinforcement learning, when both fields were in their infancy, and now I choose to study imagination, a topic that barely cites any mention in the AI/ML literature.

Each of you gets to decide what you spend your time learning — whether it is learning about Komodo dragons, block chain technology, or ML — and you spend 40 years or a week or an hour, it’s time well spent. You’ve learned something new, and you’re more well educated. Ultimately, being educated about some important topic, no matter how poorly, is what will save humanity.

If I had to pick one topic that I would urge all of you to understand, particularly if you are young, it is climate change. It will not affect me much, since I expect that by 2050, when the dire effects of climate change start to wreak havoc, I will have moved on to the next phase of my existence! But, for those of you in your 20’s, you will be entering the same age that I am today, and your lives will be ruled by the terrifying economic and social and political consequences of climate change. And if there is anything we can do about it, at this penultimate hour, it will only come about if we are prepared to educate ourselves about it with an open mind.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1?top_ans=160316067,2019-08-12T01:30:22.790716+00:00,,171,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"In my opinion, these are some of the necessary skills:

UPDATE: I create a repo on github of hundreds of software links that should help get you started: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning

1. Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5])

2. Probability and Statistics: A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.

3. Applied Math + Algorithms: For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16].

4. Distributed Computing: Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21].

5. Expertise in Unix Tools: Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1].

6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects: HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale.

7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques: feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though.

Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.

Good luck.

How does a total beginner start to learn machine learning if they have some knowledge of programming languages?,"A lot of answers here are talking about Coursera online courses, I would probably say that it is cool to do online courses but I didn't learn machine learning (ML) that way, I learned by doing, practicing the stuff for years continuously even to this very day I still code up some ML algorithms and slowly growing my own library for ML and computer vision.

I read a lot of journals i.e the recent interesting paper from Google DeepMind WaveNet  [ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf ]and over the past 6+ years I have read a lot of journals covering a lot of algorithms in ML from k-means clustering [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering ] and hierarchical clustering [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering ] through support vector machine [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine ] to deep learning [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning ] algorithms. I normally read a single journal 8 or so times before understanding the underlying stuff. I also complement the journals by watching YouTube presentation videos such as

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E
or referencing to Wikipedia or other sources such as answers on Quora.

I am mainly self-driven thus I can set goals and pursue them even without a mentor I get things done. For example at some point I had little understanding of the underlying backpropagation algorithm but when I set a goal to understand it I was able to do that just by using a Wikipedia article on backpropagation [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation ] and in one day I was even able to code my own backprop algorithm to optimize my very own neural networks in my library. I recycle a lot of knowledge to avoid wasting time and I learn by first principal.

My self-studies are triggered by curiosity, I would first become curious when I encounter a particular technology then I would think about the possibilities by brainstorming then I would identify the stuff I need to understand in order to fully grasp the technology at hand. I would then take a few days or weeks depending on the complexity of the problem at hand researching the technology and to be able to code up the stuff, I normally use my own library to speed up the coding of the algorithms which I have been building upon for some years now.

Thus the methodology I use is an engineering approach to solving problems, the answers here are suggesting a more scientific approach which is good for most people I guess, on my part the engineering methodology helps me learn more practical stuff because I learn ML and computer vision for practical reasons because I am building a robot operating system. I didn't learn ML or computer vision to get a job but just to build complex systems like I am working on a very advanced vision system called IRIS-(integrated recognition and inference system) to process visual stimuli using novel learning algorithms. The IRIS system so far learns using very few training examples and it is designed to achieve one-shot learning via a complex form of transfer learning which I designed but I am still doing finishing touches on it plus run several experiments.

On your part since you are just beginning, you need to know some maths such as linear algebra, numerical optimization, differential calculus and statistical analysis. I personally know those stuff because I am an electronics engineer by profession, so if you are starting from scratch completely make sure to know your maths and learn coding as well such as in Python, Java and C/C++. Then start reading journal after journal and practice a lot by coding stuff from scratch, it will take you some time to start getting used to this routine but it will make you one of the best in the field.

It is okay you can also take online courses as suggested by most answers here such as Coursera or others that is up to you but you need to be passionate and curious in order to learn such complex stuff on your own. You also need to be open-minded and learn as you go.

Here is an example of the many journals I have read: NOTE: I read based upon the task I am currently working on so all these journals will show you a snapshot of the complexity of the stuff I am currently working on.

What is machine learning in layman's terms?,"Well, the answer given by Fabien seems specific and technical.

I'll try to draw an analogy with life examples. Of course, I am not going to cover all topics, but some popular terms you may have heard in ML are here.

Machine Learning is about making decision based on trial and error and is a more application oriented version of statistics. The basic idea is to make decisions based on certain amount of information you have. 

Classification based on data
1. You have seen people screw up their lives by smoking. You make the decision that neither you nor your kids will ever smoke because you learnt in life that smoking kills.

2. You have observed that fat people tend to have heart diseases. You make the decision that you will try to remain thin, else you'll suffer from heart diseases.

Mathematically, you have observed a ton of data, and come up with a rule for classification. You have decided that a certain characteristic means class A, else class B.


Gradient Descent
1. When you touch a hot plate, you get hurt, you pull back your hand. You are unlikely to touch a hot plate again on purpose. Or you use mittens next time.

2. While throwing darts at a target, you don't get it right at the first shot. You move your aim and change the force, which makes you think that you'll get closer to the bulls eye. You miss again, you calculate again, and change your tactics again, till you get very close or you hit the bulls eye (or you get bored after wasting a ton of time ad quit)
Mathematically, you are doing trial and error. You look at a random attempt, calculate the error made. Then you calculate the change in your technique which you expect will lead to a better result. Then you try out the new technique. 


Online Learning
1. You play black jack. Based on the sequence of cards you see, you make a quick decision whether to hit or to stay
2. You are a trader, you are getting sequential data of a stock, you decide when to buy and sell.
Mathematically, you are now faced with the task of making quick decisions. Based on previous information you have and looking at what happens, you decide quickly. For example, you have kept count of cards in Black Jack, and you'll know when you want to raise the stakes if the count is high.

Transfer Learning
1. Your mom taught you how to choose oranges. She sends you to the grocery to buy apples. Though you don't know how to, you can use some common sense to do this.
2. You know how to play tennis, shouldn't take long to pick squash.
This is essentially what the HR of companies term as transferable skills.

Regression
1. You get the data for house price vs area of house. You plot this on a graph. You see that it is almost a straight line. You approximately draw the straight line, and now you think you cna predict the price of the house if someone tells you the area.
Machines do it in a more mathematical and formal way.


Now replace yourself with a machine, and give the machine some steps to follow so that it can learn the same things like you. A machine lacks the thinking power to manage an unexpected scenario, but it doesn't make mistakes on the basis of what it has learnt (and is faster than you). So now, the machine is learning from its environment, and we call it Machine Learning.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-machine-learning-4?top_ans=2601388,2013-05-30T17:08:53.375956+00:00,2013-05-31T03:31:30.675015+00:00,205,Anonymous,
What is machine learning?,"Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence and is revolutionizing the way companies do business. At it’s core, it’s an algorithm or model that learns patterns in big data and then predicts similar patterns in new data. In layman’s terms, it’s the theory that machines should be able to learn and adapt through experience to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results.

While ML isn’t new, theres now more data than ever which has attributed to it’s recent popularity.

So, where have you seen Machine Learning in your everyday life?

-You know those show/movie recommendations you get on Netflix? Machine learning

-Ever get a call or text from your bank regarding what they believe to be a fraudulent charge? Machine learning

-The self-driving Google car? Machine learning

I’m in the Project Management software [ http://taskreports.com ] space, so this is a very exciting time as many companies, such as ClickUp, are currently testing Machine Learning [ https://clickup.com/blog/machine-learning-ml-vs-artificial-intelligence-ai-whats-the-difference/ ]. By incorporating ML into PM tools, the software will be able to predict which actions an individual is likely to take.

Automated actions, resource planning, and smarter decisions are just a few of the benefits we are looking forward to in my industry.

This will totally shift the way projects are run and have a positive impact on the performance of all human kind!

What is machine learning?,"The classical definition is that it is the study of algorithms that infer the function they compute from example data. An example of this is the ""Theory of the Learnable"" paper which is arguably the seminal machine learning publication (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1972). In this sense it is meant to be computer science's answer to induction.

This definition is probably too narrow now, as the idea of inferring a function from examples makes the most sense with classification or regression problems and makes less sense with clustering or other problems.

Historically, machine learning was something of a reaction within artificial intelligence research. AI focused heavily on logic rather than probability or statistics, and preferred heuristic and search to formal optimization. It was also a fairly open ended research program in which it is relatively hard to judge progress. The popularity of machine learning in academia was probably due to the lack of success and growing skepticism people had of AI research in the late 80s. Machine learning is, in comparison, an extremely well defined area focusing on concrete algorithmic and mathematical problems. Focusing on better defined problems with concrete measures of progress probably helped researchers insulate themselves from the discouragement with AI generally (and lack of funding).

In actual practice, I think machine learning is just a combination of mathematical optimization and statistics, both academic disciplines in their own right. Machine learning is currently riding something of a popularity wave. My belief is that this is because machine learning is a part of computer science, and hence its practitioners are highly trained computer programmers. 
This has allowed applications of machine learning in data intensive areas like voice recognition, search, social network analysis, recommendation algorithms, computer vision, etc. Basically the machine learning people got the cool applications and hence the funding. They also had the freedom to ignore some of the culture baggage of traditional statistics, in no small part due to ignorance of it.

The current state of the field is that algorithms exist that can be used to solve a single well-defined problem, often better than humans can (for example creating a classifier to recognize spam). However significant work generally needs to be done to get data into a form that is algorithmically usable. Furthermore, these algorithms do not match people's expectation of human intelligence in that they learn a single thing very precisely, but can't learn more than one thing (the same instance of the classifier that predicts spam, won't also predict the stock market). Hence it is not possible for a program to learn like a human learns, continually acquiring new concepts and ideas and understanding the relationship between them.

So we are safe from the machines for a little longer.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-machine-learning-4?top_ans=256693,2011-01-10T07:44:15.465875+00:00,2011-01-10T07:46:51.168398+00:00,105,Jay Kreps,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jay-Kreps

How does machine learning work?,"Machine learning works by finding a function, or a relationship, from input X to output Y.

Huh?

Alright, let’s start from the basics.


What is machine learning?

The high level and most commonly accepted definition is: machine learning is the ability for computers to learn and act without being explicitly programmed.

For example, let’s say you want to program a program to play a game- chess (or Go). There are two fundamentally different ways to go about programming such a bot.

1. The first approach is to explicitly program the instructions your bot will take. If the board is in a certain configuration (state), move your knight to B4. Or if the board is in another state, move your pawn to C4. This hard-coded method isn’t particularly practical or appealing since it is near-impossible for the programmer to consider all of the possible scenarios beforehand.
2. The second approach is to simply program your bot with the rules of chess. Then, let the bot play thousands of games and let it decide which moves to make given a certain configuration. You can reward it when it wins or punish it when it loses, so it “learns” which moves are “good” by rewarding them.
For the game of chess, the input would be a board configuration (X) and the output would be your bot’s next move (Y).

Hopefully, after training, your bot will have found the function that outputs the best move (Y), given a certain game configuration (X). Remember that a function is just a relationship between an input and output.

However, the key takeaway is that the bot is not hard-coded to output anything. All the moves it makes is “learned” through training.


The chess example above falls under Reinforcement Learning, which is a branch of Machine Learning. The other branches include Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

Supervised learning is when you have knowledge of the input (X) and the output (Y), then you “supervise” the program in predicting the right outcome via trial and error. An example would be predicting house prices:

 * Input X: 10,000 houses- you know the area, city, and age of each house
 * Output Y (known): 10,000 house prices
You want to find the function that can most accurately predict the house price (Y) given the various inputs (X).


Unsupervised learning is when you have zero knowledge of the output and you want to try to find patterns or groupings within the data. Think clustering:

 * Input X: a city
 * Output Y(unknown): most densely populated areas
You want to find the mapping from a city (X) to the most densely populated areas (Y).

Some more examples can be found in the picture below.


Conclusion

At the core of every machine learning algorithm, all the algorithm is trying to do is find a relationship from the input X to the output Y. How exactly it finds this function varies by the algorithm.

But almost all algorithms require a lot of computations. And a lot of revisions. And usually a good amount of data.

For a basic example, I point you here [ https://www.quora.com/How-does-machine-learning-work/answer/Lyken-Syu-1 ].

Happy learning.

P.S. As a side note, one of the main reasons Deep Learning has been doing extremely well is that Neural Networks have been proven to be an Universal Function Approximater, meaning that it can approximate any function between X or Y- given enough data of course.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-machine-learning-4?top_ans=67860565,2017-12-28T04:15:17.259400+00:00,2017-12-28T04:22:19.515800+00:00,103,Maverick Lin,https://www.quora.com/profile/Maverick-Lin
What is machine learning?,"Hey there!

Let's talk about machine learning – it's like teaching computers to learn from data and make decisions all on their own. Imagine you have a super-smart robot buddy 🤖 who gets better at tasks as it sees more examples. That's machine learning in a nutshell!

📚 Learning from Data 📊

So, instead of telling the robot exactly what to do step by step, we give it loads of examples (data) and let it figure things out by itself. It's a bit like how you learn to recognize dogs 🐶 by seeing lots of different dog pictures.

🎓 Types of Machine Learning 🤓

There are a few ways machines can learn:

 * Supervised Learning: Think of it like having a teacher. We show the robot examples with labels (like ""this is a dog"" or ""this is a cat""), and it learns to make predictions based on those labels.
 * Unsupervised Learning: No teacher here! The robot looks at a bunch of data without labels and tries to find patterns or groups all on its own, like sorting candies by color without being told.
 * Semi-supervised Learning: It's a mix of both! Some examples have labels, and some don't. The robot uses the labeled examples to learn and then tries to apply that knowledge to the unlabeled ones.
 * Reinforcement Learning: This one's like a game. The robot learns by taking actions in an environment and getting rewards or punishments. It's like teaching a puppy tricks with treats 🐕.
Some very cool options for you are-

 * Learnbay “Advanced AI & ML Certification Program”- Offers hybrid learning (online) and (offline) and is one of the most popular courses for business analytics.

Offers IBM and Microsoft-based certifications with job assistance and simulated capstone and simulated real-time projects in (AWS, CI/CD, etc) with domain specialization in Advanced ML Automotive, IoT and Embedded, AI, etc. Domain in BFSI, Healthcare, Supply Chain, or Manufacturing.

🌟 Applications of Machine Learning 🚀

Machine learning is everywhere! It powers things like:

 * 📸 Image recognition: Helping computers identify objects in pictures.
 * 🎤 Speech recognition: Turning your words into text or commands.
 * 💬 Natural language processing: Understanding and generating human language.
 * 🚗 Self-driving cars: Teaching cars to navigate roads safely.
Machine learning is all about teaching computers to learn and improve from data, just like we do. It's pretty cool stuff and has tons of exciting applications in our everyday lives.

What is machine learning in layman's terms?,"The human brain is exceptionally good at many things: conscious thought, emotions, memory, control of movement, not to mention the five senses that let us take in the world around us.  It's also good at detecting patterns in the countless signals that come in through those five senses.  But the brain isn't perfect, and there are some problems that are so complex that they are better suited for computers than for people.  This is the realm of machine learning.

""Machine learning"" is a bit of a misnomer.  To the uninitiated, the term conjures up images of R2-D2, Wall-E, or HAL.  In reality it's just as powerful, but doesn't have quite the same star power: it refers to any systematic way of finding patterns or similarities in data, usually for the purpose of making predictions.  There are lots of different ways to do this, ranging from techniques you can do by hand (machine learning with pencil and paper!) to computationally intensive algorithms that tax even the most powerful supercomputer.

Machine learning algorithms come in different flavors.  One commonly used class of algorithms is known as ""supervised"" algorithms, because the learning is guided by observations with known outcomes—these are treated as the ""ground truth.""  For example, to create a model for predicting who will win an NFL football game, you might start by looking at games over the past decade, so you already know who ended up winning.  You would create a number of ""features""—signals for each game that might be useful for predicting a win or a loss, such as the team's average scoring per game, statistics about its offense and defense, its opponent, etc.  If you were only interested in predicting who would win a game in the future, you would then use an algorithm to create a model for ""classification""—simply taking all of the features for a new game and mapping them onto either a win or a loss.  If you cared about predicting the final score, or how much a team would win or lose by, you'd use an algorithm for ""regression,"" and your output would be a real number (like ""win by 7 points"") rather than just a classification (""win"").

Another common type of algorithm is known as ""unsupervised,"" and the name is apt: unlike its counterpart it doesn't use known outcomes to guide the learning.  Clustering algorithms are one example.  They take features from many different observations and simply look for similarities that make certain observations group together.  If you were to take physical measurements of people—height, weight, etc.—and apply a clustering algorithm, you might find that two clusters emerge, one for men and one for women.  This is because women tend to be more similar to other women in their physical measurements, and men more similar to other men.  The perk of using unsupervised algorithms is that they can reveal underlying structure in a data set (like the presence of two different sexes) even when you didn't know you should be looking for it.  Often, finding clusters when you didn't expect them is a great motivation for doing further research to find out the meaning of the groupings.

At my company, Prophecy Sciences, we primarily use supervised machine learning algorithms to predict people's workplace and athletic performance.  We generate hundreds of behavioral and physiological data features using a suite of cognitive games and biosensors, and we use our algorithms to create models that map these features to known outcome measures of all of the people who have taken the Prophecy assessment.  By applying those models we can then make predictions about the workplace or athletic performance of someone new who takes the assessment.  This approach allows us to discover which data features are actually predictive of top performers, rather than go by intuition alone.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-machine-learning-4?top_ans=3550614,2013-11-19T20:25:24.898547+00:00,,28,Bob Schafer,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bob-Schafer-1
What is machine learning?,"A branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science called machine learning combines data and algorithms to simulate how people learn, gradually increasing its accuracy. Storage and processing advances over the past two decades have made it possible for some innovative machine learning-based systems, such as Netflix's recommendation engine and self-driving cars.

Machine learning is a critical component of the rapidly expanding discipline of data science. Algorithms are taught using statistical approaches to produce classifications or predictions and to find critical insights in data mining operations.

How machine learning works

 * A Decision Process: Machine learning algorithms are typically used to create a prediction or classification. Your algorithm will generate an estimate about a pattern in the data based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled.
 * An Error Function: An error function evaluates the model's prediction. If there are known instances, an error function can compare to determine the model's accuracy.
 * A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit the data points in the training set better, weights are modified to narrow the gap between the known example and the model prediction. The algorithm will repeat this ""evaluate and optimize"" procedure, updating weights autonomously until an accuracy criterion is reached.
What is the significance of machine learning?

Machine learning is significant because it provides organizations with insights into trends in customer behavior and business operating patterns, as well as assisting in the development of new products.

What is machine learning?,"Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence, where the computer ""learns"" about something without being explicitly programmed.

The approach can be used for tasks such as spam filtering, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). This AI-based method has also been incorporated into other applications including self-driving cars, personal assistants, and online advertising.

Machine learning systems adapt through experience over time, meaning that they improve with every additional dose of information or training.

The machine's behavior is determined by algorithms that encode its experiences. For instance, the algorithms can be used for predictions about outcomes based on previously observed inputs and outputs.

In essence, a machine learning algorithm treats its own experience as data to be analyzed in order to infer answers.

Machine Learning: Where does it appear?

In the broadest sense, we can talk about machine learning in two major contexts- Generalized AI and Application Specific AI.

Generalized AI, or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), is the type of intelligence that aims to produce human-like behavior such as a robot performing a useful service, an information filtering system on the web providing search results just like Google, or a self-driving car driving us to our destination without hitting any pedestrians.

Application-Specific AI is aimed at solving one specific problem. In this context, there are two types: Deep Machine Learning: This approach involves training deep neural networks to learn from large amounts of data and then use this learning to solve problems. Supervised Machine Learning: In supervised machine learning, the system is trained on a set of examples that have been manually labeled by humans. The labels are then used to train a predictive model which can be used for classification or regression tasks in applications such as document classification, spam detection, image recognition, etc.

Machine Learning: How does it work?

Machine learning algorithms typically need two things in order to operate- training data and a function called an objective. Training data consists of an input vector (a sequence), along with its correct output value, according to some objective function. This input includes both constant values and values generated randomly by the machine for testing purposes. The machine then uses the training data in order to try and find an input-output mapping that will produce the correct output every time.

For example, consider a binary classifier (this is a classification algorithm that outputs only 0 or 1). It takes in data as an input and tries to predict which category it belongs to by looking at patterns found within the data. For instance, if we have pictures of dogs and cats labeled respectively as ""dog"" and ""cat"", our learning algorithm would be trained on this information so as to distinguish between them properly. We can say that the logic behind this process is: given any picture, predict whether it's of a dog or cat. The question here is how does one get these pictures of dogs and cats in the first place? They are labeled randomly by humans so that the machine can learn how to distinguish between them.

Machine Learning: Characteristics

Every machine learning algorithm is trained on a set of training data with a specific input-output mapping objective function or cost function. The choice of this function determines the quality of the model (since it measures tradeoffs). Costs functions used in ML algorithms typically aim at minimizing prediction error or maximizing classification accuracy. While many standard cost functions exist, they all differ slightly in their implementations.

In terms of fairness towards different types of data points, some common metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and cross-entropy. All of these metrics try to measure how bad it is for an algorithm to classify one data point as belonging to a certain category when it actually belongs to a different category. In other words, they reward the machine's success rate while penalizing its failure rate.

The cost function that is used will also vary depending on the type of problem that is being solved. The most famous types are classification problems and regression problems. In classification problems, the type of data is discrete- meaning there can be only one class or answer for every piece of information (examples include spam detection, face recognition, etc.). In regression problems, the type of data is continuous with an infinite number of possible answers- this means that every piece of information can be assigned multiple possible answers (examples include real-time price prediction, medical diagnosis, etc.).

Machine Learning: Types of Algorithms

To solve a given problem, practitioners must identify an appropriate learning algorithm to use. A general rule of thumb is that for classification problems we should choose algorithms with high accuracy and for regression problems we should choose algorithms that are accurate but more robust since absolute error rate isn't important. Here are some examples: Linear Regression: Linear regression uses the concept of linearity to predict continuous values based on a number of input variables. It minimizes the sum of squared error in order to achieve this. This type of algorithm tends to be fast and scalable for big data sets as it avoids iterating through all possible solutions; however, it is unstable.

In a nutshell: Linear regression uses linearity to find an equation for predicting a continuous value based on 2 or more input variables. Logistic Regression: A binary classifier, logistic regression is used when there are only two possible outcomes (0/1). It minimizes the error rate of false positives and false negatives- this means that under no circumstances should we predict something true as false or vice versa.

Neural Networks: In ML, neural networks are a tool in classification problems and incorporate concepts from neuroscience such as how human brains function. They're used when the data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value. Neural networks consist of multiple hidden layers of neurons with different activation functions at each layer and a final layer for producing results. They're used to solve problems that are non-linear or otherwise difficult to tackle using other algorithms.

Neural Networks: two most common activation functions include sigmoid (also called logistic function) and step. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is known as the ""Northeast"" algorithm in several academic circles; it's widely considered to be the best supervised discriminative learning model available today for classification problems. It's particularly useful when there's only one target label, that data points are linearly separable/contiguous, and that samples from all classes are roughly the same size.

However, SVM is also known to be unstable and expensive for most real-world problems. SVMs fall into either the linear or the non-linear category depending on whether their decision boundary corresponds to a hyperplane or not. Tree-based algorithms: Many classification problems can be represented as a tree structure where every internal node represents a test with boolean value and an edge between two nodes indicates that if we take the right path at one node we must go left at the other to get out of it (examples include C4.5, CHAID, etc.). Decision trees are used when data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value; they're designed through recursive binary splitting (splitting at the node with maximum information gain).

Tree-based algorithms: C4.5 and CHAID are the two most popular examples of Decision Tree Learning. Boosting: Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that's often used when the data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value (examples include AdaBoost, GBDT, etc.). It basically involves training a number of weak classifiers by using some initial probability distribution and then combining them in order to deliver better results than what each individual classifier would deliver on its own. It was initially developed for tackling problems with imbalanced classes (where one class is present in much larger numbers compared to others).",https://www.quora.com/What-is-machine-learning-4?top_ans=304051437,2021-08-25T13:42:44.692412+00:00,,20,Harsh Gupta,https://www.quora.com/profile/Harsh-Gupta-2712
What is machine learning?,"A Little Intro:

One of the thriving areas of artificial intelligence is machine learning. Machine learning had existed long before I was born, so why has it gained such traction after nearly 50 years? We now have access to an enormous amount of data, whether as images, text, audio, or video—this data power machine learning.

There are two schools of thought when it comes to Learning,

 * learning by example, humans learn everything by example.
 * Humans learn due to innate capabilities that yet need figuring.
The first thought was adopted to train machines using past data /examples/ samples, and that's the basis of the current state of the art for machine learning.

Machine learning basics:

Machine learning uses the same idea as human Learning to teach machines to learn from past data and perform tasks at a much faster pace than humans. Let's use an example to illustrate how it happens. So relax and read; I'll use a famous example. Assume you want to discover what kind of song a person likes or dislikes based on several parameters such as voice gender, genre, tempo, mood, and personal preference. Let's say this person likes rapid, soaring music and dislikes light, calm music. Feeding the machine various samples of his/her likes and dislikes, the machine can determine whether or not the next song I choose is one of his/her preferences.

As I have trained the machine with examples for his likes and dislikes based on tempo and intensity, now if I ask if he likes “x” song? The machine here choosing an algorithm (K-nearest neighbor) decides that “x” is a song that this person ""likes""( as its nearest neighbors lie more in the like group).

That was something that everyone could see while listening to their favorite music on Spotify, Gaana, or any other music streaming service. It uses machine learning to recommend a song based on the player’s song selection.

Ways you can make machines learn:

Supervised Learning: In my previous example, I could train my machine with samples in which I've already stated that the person ""likes"" and ""dislikes"" certain songs, i.e., I've noted a decision with each instance. Supervised Learning is when the decision/conclusion associated with the set of parameters is already known. In supervised Learning, these decisions are usually called labels. We fed the machine with labeled data.

Unsupervised Learning: You train your machine with different parameters here, but there is no decision associated with it. It does grouping using various techniques(algorithms) to assist humans in making decisions regarding multiple groups. In unsupervised learning, we fed the machine with unlabeled data.

Reinforcement learning: This is reward-based Learning that works on feedback. We give positive feedback for each correct action performed by the machine, while negative feedback for each erroneous action. Here again, we make use of Unlabeled data.

Is ML currently overhyped?

 * A ""No"" ML is not overhyped if you can comprehend its practical limitations. Minds that feel appealed towards ML should study and explore what benefits it can accomplish, for ML to succeed.
 * And a ""Yes"" ML is overhyped when your expectations are projected to boundaries beyond practicality. Thanks to marketing geniuses and movies for misleading people about what ML actually offers.
There is a distinction to be made between what a few have promised and what ML can realistically deliver. After all, it's not a genie but a well-understood field with enormous potential for any industry that seeks to benefit from its practical applications.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-machine-learning-4?top_ans=325818980,2021-12-14T11:32:33.490912+00:00,2021-12-24T07:38:44.701641+00:00,6,Rafia Nahvi,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rafia-Nahvi-1

How does machine learning work?,"Machine learning works by finding a function, or a relationship, from input X to output Y.

Huh?

Alright, let’s start from the basics.


What is machine learning?

The high level and most commonly accepted definition is: machine learning is the ability for computers to learn and act without being explicitly programmed.

For example, let’s say you want to program a program to play a game- chess (or Go). There are two fundamentally different ways to go about programming such a bot.

1. The first approach is to explicitly program the instructions your bot will take. If the board is in a certain configuration (state), move your knight to B4. Or if the board is in another state, move your pawn to C4. This hard-coded method isn’t particularly practical or appealing since it is near-impossible for the programmer to consider all of the possible scenarios beforehand.
2. The second approach is to simply program your bot with the rules of chess. Then, let the bot play thousands of games and let it decide which moves to make given a certain configuration. You can reward it when it wins or punish it when it loses, so it “learns” which moves are “good” by rewarding them.
For the game of chess, the input would be a board configuration (X) and the output would be your bot’s next move (Y).

Hopefully, after training, your bot will have found the function that outputs the best move (Y), given a certain game configuration (X). Remember that a function is just a relationship between an input and output.

However, the key takeaway is that the bot is not hard-coded to output anything. All the moves it makes is “learned” through training.


The chess example above falls under Reinforcement Learning, which is a branch of Machine Learning. The other branches include Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

Supervised learning is when you have knowledge of the input (X) and the output (Y), then you “supervise” the program in predicting the right outcome via trial and error. An example would be predicting house prices:

 * Input X: 10,000 houses- you know the area, city, and age of each house
 * Output Y (known): 10,000 house prices
You want to find the function that can most accurately predict the house price (Y) given the various inputs (X).


Unsupervised learning is when you have zero knowledge of the output and you want to try to find patterns or groupings within the data. Think clustering:

 * Input X: a city
 * Output Y(unknown): most densely populated areas
You want to find the mapping from a city (X) to the most densely populated areas (Y).

Some more examples can be found in the picture below.


Conclusion

At the core of every machine learning algorithm, all the algorithm is trying to do is find a relationship from the input X to the output Y. How exactly it finds this function varies by the algorithm.

But almost all algorithms require a lot of computations. And a lot of revisions. And usually a good amount of data.

Happy learning.

As a side note, one of the main reasons Deep Learning has been doing extremely well is that Neural Networks have been proven to be an Universal Function Approximater, meaning that it can approximate any function between X or Y- given enough data of course.",https://www.quora.com/How-does-machine-learning-work?top_ans=67860565,2017-12-28T04:15:17.259400+00:00,2017-12-28T04:22:19.515800+00:00,103,Maverick Lin,https://www.quora.com/profile/Maverick-Lin

It’s a simple overview of machine learning : giving feedback during training to make its answer close to what we expect. And since it’s impossible to include everything in one answer, if you want to know more details, I’d suggest you to learn Machine Learning [ http://cs229.stanford.edu ].",https://www.quora.com/How-does-machine-learning-work?top_ans=27325602,2016-09-03T03:04:05.219481+00:00,,653,Lyken Syu,https://www.quora.com/profile/Lyken-Syu-1
How does machine learning work?,"First I should point out that it's impossible to generalize because there are many different types of machine learning and they all work a little differently. Machine learning is a very broad term and simply means methods of giving a computer known input-output relations and getting it to predict the output given new, unknown inputs. If I'm honest, when I first learned how a neural network worked, I was a little disappointed because there's no magic: it's just a generalization of linear regression fitting. Most machine learning techniques are essentially statistical in nature.

Here I will explain how a neural network works because it is one of the most common and basic methods. First, you have a set of known, input-output relations. To express this mathematically, you could say that [math]\vec x_i \rightarrow y_i[/math] where i goes from 1 to n. Note that the inputs are vectors whereas the output is scalar. To deal with vector outputs, you can train multiple models. The above mapping is called the training data.

Next, you have a function that takes an input in the same form and returns an output, also in the same form. This function should have two properties: it is nonlinear and it has a series of coefficients which can be varied so as to emulate a variety of other functions. Again, expressing this mathematically:

[math]y=f(\vec x,~\vec k)[/math]

where k is a vector of coefficients. We need to vary these coefficients so that the function f, or model, returns y values as close to those in the above mapping, given the corresponding input x values, as possible. Thus we need to train it by varying the coefficients and feeding both the results from f and the training data to a cost function which measures the goodness of fit.

Lets express the cost function as follows:

[math]C [ f(\vec x_i,~\vec k),~y_i ][/math]

So we are feeding both the results of the model, given the inputs, and the known outputs to C and getting back only a single result which measures the goodness of fit. Note that we need to feed all of the training data to the cost function, thus it has 2*n parameters. We need to minimize C with respect to the coefficients, k. This is typically expressed as follows:

[math]\underset{\vec k}{\min} C [ f(\vec x_i,~\vec k),~y_i ][/math]

The most common form of C is a sum of squares:

[math]C=\sum_{i=1}^n \left [f(\vec x_i) - y_i \right ]^2[/math]

Making this a least squares problem. For brevity, I've omitted the coefficients from f.

Because f is non-linear, there is usually no closed-form solution to the minimization problem, and we must solve it by an iterative, numerical algorithm. I won't go into much detail about minimization algorithms because this is a huge and diverse field, however to get a flavour of how these things work, you might want to look up Newton's method, which is easy to generalize to multiple dimensions. Another important method is gradient descent.

There are no good, general methods for multidimensional minimization and it is impossible to guarantee a global minimum except for a narrow subset of well-behaved problems. Stable methods are typically slow while faster methods tend to be unstable, so many of the best methods will combine a slow, stable method with a fast, unstable one, e.g. when things are going well, take a Newton step, while if the solution veers off, switch to gradient descent.",https://www.quora.com/How-does-machine-learning-work?top_ans=7250822,2014-09-29T16:39:31.717632+00:00,2019-08-16T04:21:26.968590+00:00,23,Peter Mills,https://www.quora.com/profile/Peter-Mills-3
What math do you need to know to learn machine learning?,"As others mentioned before, it will mostly boil down to Statistics and Linear Algebra. However, I am very surprised how vague answers are.

There are lots of different techniques that you can specialise in so I’ll try mentioning some places where you can start. Hopefully, it will make you realise, that there is a lot to cover and how you can start doing that.

Linear Algebra

Topics:

 * Vectors & Matrices
 * Matrix Multiplication & Transformations
 * Eigenvector analysis
 * Linear Equation Systems
Good place to learn:

 * Precalculus | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/ ]
 * Linear Algebra | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra ]
 * Linear Algebra [ https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm ]
 * http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf
Calculus

Basically, you need to be able to do derivative and integration inside out.

Topics:

 * Differentiation
 * Chain Rule
 * Partial Derivatives
 * Integrals
Good places to learn:

 * AP Calculus AB | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab ]
 * Multivariable Calculus | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus ]
Statistics

Probably, the most important thing is to have a pretty decent grasp on probability density and mass functions (PDFs and PMFs) for most of the common distributions (like Gaussian, Binomial, or Exponential family).

In the end, if you know statistics really well, you can make any machine learning problem into a statistics problem. I would even claim, that the current machine learning developments (apart from deep learning) are just rediscovery of statistics with the computation power of modern computers.

Also, I will skip things like expected value, variance, and etc. because that’s basics.

Topics:

 * Distributions and their CDFs and PDFs:
 * 
 * Binomial
 * Poisson
 * Exponential family
 * 
 * Gaussian distribution in particular


 * Calculating CDFs from PDFs
 * Bayes Rule
 * Naive Bayes
 * Markov Chains
 * Belief Networks (or Graphical Models in General)
Good places to learn:

 * Statistics and probability [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability ]
 * Probability | Statistics and probability | Math | Khan Academy [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library ]
 * Journey into information theory [ https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory ]
 * http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf
Optimisation

And finally optimisation. I would say it’s just a part of Calculus (and it would look like that Khan agrees) but whatever. Here you want to be able to find the minimum or either the maximum of some function.

Topics:

 * Gradient Descend
 * Stochastic (Online) Gradient Descend
 * Expectation Maximization
Good places to learn:

 * Derivative applications [ https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/derivative-applications-calc ]
 * Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] (note: it seems that Andrew Ng is in love with gradient descend so it is covered there pretty well)
What’s next?

There is a lot of material online for machine learning online but the problem with it is that most of it is very shallow and, honestly, it isn’t worth your time.

However, I would go with the following courses:

Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ] - A great introductory course to Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. It will cover some statistics and fair amount of linear algebra. Additionally, it exposes you to some decent optimisation basics.

Probabilistic Graphical Models | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models ] - Pretty tough course by Daphne Koller. You might also want to check out a book, that the course is based on Probabilistic Graphical Models [ http://pgm.stanford.edu/ ] . The course will give you some decent intro to Bayesian Probabilistic Models.

Neural Networks for Machine Learning - University of Toronto | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks ] - Neural Nets by Jeff Hinton. If this course is anything as it was before, take it only if you are really interested in neural nets. It makes you do some proper maths, to realise how do those nets actually work. I wouldn’t take it as a beginner.

However, that course doesn’t cover some newer development in DeepNets so you might want to see CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing [ http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html ] or CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition [ http://cs231n.github.io ] to cover things like RNNs and LSTMs.

A quick peek

What it would take you to solve these?

1. Solve [math]Xw=b [/math] for w where X is data matrix and w is a weight vector and b is a target value (constant).
2. Calculate Kullback-Leibler divergence between [math]p(x)=N(x|\mu,\sigma^2) [/math]and [math]q(x)=N(x|m,s^2)[/math].
3. Prove [math]p(x,y|z) = p(x|z)p(y|x,z) [/math]
Given all of this, you should be good enough to know where to go next.

Good Luck

I am pretty sure I’ve missed some important stuff but I am also sure that this will set you on the right track.

Good luck!",https://www.quora.com/How-does-machine-learning-work?top_ans=43746855,2017-05-06T18:05:54.717458+00:00,2017-05-07T09:16:19.835468+00:00,111,Tadas Šubonis,https://www.quora.com/profile/Tadas-Šubonis

How does machine learning work?,"Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence and computational science concerned with developing computer systems able to automatically learn (and in some cases, produce new data) without being explicitly programmed.

It's the idea that computers can learn without human input and come up with new knowledge for themselves. You may have heard about machine learning before, maybe about Netflix recommending movies or Amazon suggesting products based on your browsing history.

How does machine learning operate?

Artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of machine learning trains computers to think like people do by learning from and improving upon prior experiences. It uses little to no human intervention and operates by examining data and recognizing patterns. Machine learning can automate almost any task that can be carried out using a data-defined pattern or set of rules. This enables businesses to automate tasks that, in the past, could only be completed by humans, such as taking customer service calls, maintaining books, and reviewing resumes.

Machine learning mostly employs two methods:

1. You can gather data or create a data output from an earlier ML deployment with supervised learning. Because supervised learning functions very similarly to how people actually learn, it is fascinating.
When performing supervised tasks, we provide the computer with a set of labeled data points known as a training set.

2. You can discover a wide range of unidentified patterns in data using unsupervised machine learning. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm uses only unlabeled instances to try to uncover some underlying structure in the data.

The goal of clustering is to organize data points into meaningful groups in which the components are related to one another but distinct from those of other clusters. Market segmentation is one task where clustering is advantageous.

In order to facilitate better interpretation, dimension reduction models group comparable or associated qualities to reduce the number of variables in a dataset (and more effective model training).

There are many different applications for machine learning, including finance, healthcare, and marketing. For example, machine learning can be used to predict which patients are likely to suffer from a particular disease.

So far, machine learning plays an even bigger role in different industries, how does this affect the performance of employees?

 * Machine learning professionals are required to have domain specialized expertise in their job roles - this is because the machine learning algorithms they use are designed to operate on specific types of data.
 * For example, a machine learning engineer might use algorithms designed to identify and predict patterns in financial data.
 * In addition, machine learning professionals often need to be familiar with various programming languages to implement their algorithms.
Note:

There's no question that machine learning professionals are in high demand. But to be a machine learning professional, you need to have domain-specific expertise. That means being able to understand how data is used to solve specific problems. That's where online courses come in.

But, why only online courses, why not any other resource?

That’s because, with online courses in machine learning, you can learn the basics of the field and develop the skills necessary to have domain-specific expertise. This way, you'll be able to stay ahead of the curve and ensure that your skills remain current and relevant. All of this only makes sense when you have a trainer guiding you along or some instructor giving you career-related advice.

How does machine learning work?,"Machine learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is when the computer is given a set of labeled data, and it learns to predict the output based on the input. For example, a supervised learning algorithm could be used to identify objects in an image by being trained on a dataset of labeled images. Unsupervised learning is when the computer is given a dataset without any labels, and it must find patterns or structure in the data on its own. For example, an unsupervised learning algorithm could be used to group customers by their purchasing habits. Reinforcement learning is when the computer learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. For example, a reinforcement learning algorithm could be used to train a robot to navigate through a maze by rewarding it for reaching the goal and penalizing it for hitting walls.",https://www.quora.com/How-does-machine-learning-work?top_ans=1477743686565260,2023-08-10T16:35:21.428804+00:00,,0,EIA Noida,https://www.quora.com/profile/EIA-Noida

Then, you pick a way for your friend to learn (model selection) and show them the pictures, guiding them to make predictions (training). After a bit of practice, you test their skills with new pictures (evaluation). If they slip up, you give feedback and help them get better (fine-tuning).

How does machine learning work?,"Machine learning comes under the umbrella of artificial intelligence which involves a thorough study of computer science and programming. The study of machine learning is utilized for a broad range of tasks like spam filtering, image recognition, and NLP or Natural Language Processing.

It is shown that machine learning systems might adapt to various experiences all that is necessary to improve every additional dose of training.

Usually, there are two major categories in machine learning:

1. Generalized AI
2. Application Specific AI
Machine learning algorithms mainly focus on training data with a function named ‘objective’. With the help of this process, it can show the accuracy of the work given or performed according to the given task. In general, machine learning is a vast topic, which involves in-depth knowledge of AI and programming. Thus, for developing a career in machine learning it is required to learn it from industry experts as they will be able to guide you throughout and help you understand the real-life applications.

Where can you learn the in-depth concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence?

You can either opt for an online course or an offline course, however, if you are a working professional, then it is recommended to opt for an online course as it will give you good flexibility with your classes and offers less course fee.

For the non-working students, you can learn from Great Lakes AI & ML course, Post Graduation Program in AI and ML from BITS Pilani, Post Graduation Program in AI and ML by Great Learning, etc.

For working professionals, it is recommended to learn from.

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"In my opinion, these are some of the necessary skills:

UPDATE: I create a repo on github of hundreds of software links that should help get you started: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning

1. Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5])

2. Probability and Statistics: A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.

3. Applied Math + Algorithms: For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16].

4. Distributed Computing: Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21].

5. Expertise in Unix Tools: Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1].

6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects: HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale.

7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques: feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though.

Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.

Good luck.

How does machine learning work?,"Early studies in machine learning (ML) involved hypotheses that computers could see patterns in data and learn from them. Machine learning has become increasingly complicated as a result of basic experiments.

How does machine learning work?

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that trains computers to think as humans do: by learning from and improving on past experiences. It operates by analyzing data and discovering patterns with little human participation.

Machine learning can automate almost any operation that can be accomplished using a data-defined pattern or set of rules. This enables businesses to automate operations previously only performed by humans, such as customer support, bookkeeping, and resume evaluation.

Machine learning employs two primary techniques:

 * You can use supervised learning to acquire data or generate a data output from a previous ML deployment. Supervised learning is fascinating because it operates in a similar fashion to how humans learn.
 * Unsupervised machine learning allows you to discover previously unseen patterns in data. With only unlabeled instances, the algorithm attempts to learn some intrinsic structure to the data in unsupervised learning. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are two frequent unsupervised learning tasks.
Machine learning has many applications, from automating tedious manual data entry to more complex use cases like insurance risk assessments or fraud detection. These include client-facing functions like customer service, product recommendations (see Amazon's product suggestions or Spotify's playlisting algorithms), and internal applications within organizations to help speed up processes and reduce manual workloads.

It is evident that machine learning is a career with immense growth potential. Learning the trade can only benefit you. There are many machine learning courses available today. You can join one and build an awesome career.

One of the most popular machines learning courses is offered by Udacity.

Let’s look at their features:

 * Some of their machine learning courses, such as ML with Torch or Tensorflow, are rather straightforward.
 * The training course for ML Engineer for Azure, DevOps covers all areas of machine learning (ML).
 * Machine learning training takes three months with Azure, whereas DevOps training takes four months.
 * These classes are self-paced, and students can enroll anytime they want. Various projects aimed at imparting industry skills are included in each curriculum.
 * Mentors are available for guidance and assistance during the course.
 * They assist you in building your portfolio while also assessing and commenting on your work.
 * There are two entry price options: pay as you go or pay for the entire duration of the course.
It does, however, have a substantial disadvantage. Udacity does not provide domain-specific training, which is the most important factor in securing a job.

Another institute that provides top machine learning courses is Learnbay. They provide the best machine learning courses in Bangalore, which can be accessed from anywhere.

Learnbay's Advance Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program

 * Duration: 9-11 Months

How does machine learning work?,"Machine learning is defined under the category of artificial intelligence where the computer studies a new thing that is programmed by the computer. The approach of machine learning is used for a wide range of tasks such as spam filtering, natural language processing or NLP, and image recognition.

Studies showed that machine learning systems can adapt through various experiences, which means they will improve with every additional dose of training. Generally, there are two contexts in machine learning Generalized AI and Application Specific AI.

Machine learning algorithms require two things to operate such as training data and a function named ‘objective’. Overall, machine learning is a vast topic that requires in-depth knowledge of AI and programming. Hence, if you want to learn it for your career advancement then, it is recommended to opt for the Advanced AI and ML program for tech professionals.

What are the options to study a full-time machine learning course?

How do I learn mathematics for machine learning?,"Great question! How indeed does one prepare oneself for a (research or otherwise) career in machine learning, in particular in terms of familiarizing oneself with the underlying mathematics? I’m going to resist the temptation of trotting out some standard books, and instead, focus on giving broad advice.

There’s some bad news on this front, and it’s best to get this out of the way as quickly as possible. Having spent 35+ years studying machine learning, let me put this in the most direct way possible: no matter how much time and effort you devote to it, you can never know enough math to read through all the ML literature. Different parts of ML use a variety of esoteric math. There’s just no way one person can know all of this math, so it’s good to be forewarned.

OK, with that out of the way, how does one prepare oneself? Think of the process analogous to conditioning your mind and body to run a marathon. It’s a gradual process, of improving your fitness, your ability to run for longer and longer distances, your breathing technique, your mental focus, and dozens of other dimensions. Working in ML is not like running a 100 meter sprint, where the race is pretty much over in a single breath. It’s much more of an endurance sport, where you have to constantly work at it to remain in shape, and there’s no point at which you can relax and say: OK, I know it all! Because no one does!

An example from my recent work will clarify the issues involved. One of the major challenges in machine learning is that there’s never enough training data to tackle every ML problem that presents itself. Humans are especially adept in solving this challenge. I can get on a flight from San Francisco and within a few short hours find myself in a dizzying diversity of new environments, from the glitzy subways of Tokyo and the bleak winter in Scandinavia to an arid savannah in Africa, or a swampy rainforest in Brazil. There’s no way I can ever hope to collect training samples from every possible environment that I can encounter in life. So, what do we do? We transfer our learned knowledge from places we’ve been — so, having taken the BART subway in San Francisco, and subways in New York and London, I can try to handle the complexity of the subway in Tokyo by drawing upon my previous experience. Of course, it doesn’t quite match — the language is completely different, the tone and texture of the visual experience is completely different (attendants in gloved hands show you the way in Tokyo — no such luxury is available in the US!). Yet, we somehow manage, and plod our way through new experiences. We even cherish the prospect of finding ourselves in some alien new culture, where we don’t speak the language and can’t ask for directions. It opens up our mind to new horizons, all part of the charm of travel.

So, what’s the mathematics involved in implementing a transfer learning algorithm? It varies a lot depending on what type of approach you investigate. Let’s review some approaches from computer vision over the past few years. One class of approaches are so-called subspace methods, where the training data from a collection of images in the “source” domain (which conveniently has labels given to us) is to be compared with a collection of unlabeled images from a “target” domain (e.g., “source” → NY subway, “target” → Tokyo subway).

One can take a collection of images of size NxN and using a variety of different methods find the smallest subspace that the source images lie in (treating each image as a vector in N^2 dimensions). Now, to understand this body of work, you obviously need to know some linear algebra. So, if you don’t understand linear algebra, or you took a class way back when and forgot it all, it’s time to refresh your memory or learn anew. Fortunately, there are excellent textbooks (Strang is usually a good place to start) and also something like MATLAB will let you explore linear algebraic ML methods without having to implement things like eigenvalue or singular value decomposition. As I usually told my students, keep the motto “eigen do it if I try” in mind. Persevere, and keep the focus on why you are learning this math. Because it is important and essential to understand much of modern ML.

OK, great, you’ve managed to learn some linear algebra. Are you done? Ummm, not quite. So, back to our transfer learning example. You construct a source subspace from the source images, and a target subspace from the target images. Umm, how does one do that. OK, you can use a garden variety dimensionality reduction method like principal components analysis (PCA), which just computes the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the source and target images. This is one subroutine call in MATLAB. But, PCA is 100 years old. How about something new and cool, like a ooh la la subspace tracking method like GOUDA, which uses the fancier math of Lie groups. Oops, now you need to learn some group theory, the mathematics of symmetry. As it turns out, matrices of certain types, like all invertible matrices, or all positive definite matrices, are not just linear algebraic objects, they are also of interest in group theory, a particularly important subfield of which is Lie groups (Lie → “Lee”).

OK, great, you have a smattering of knowledge of group theory and Lie groups. Are you done? Hmmm…actually not, because it turns out Lie groups are not just groups, but they are also continuous manifolds. What in the blazes is a “manifold”? If you google this, you are likely to encounter web pages describing engine parts! No, a manifold is something entirely different in machine learning, where it means a non-Euclidean space that has curvature. It turns out the set of all probability distributions (e.g., 1 dimensional Gaussians with a scalar variance dimension and a scalar mean dimension) are not Euclidean, but rather, describe a curved space. So, the set of all positive definite matrices form a Lie group, with a certain curvature. What this implies is that obvious operations like taking the average have to done with considerable care. So, off you go, learning all there is to know about manifolds, Riemannian manifolds, tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, exp and log mappings, etc. Oh, what fun!

Getting back to our transfer learning method, if you compute the source covariance matrix C_s and the target covariance matrix C_t, then there is a simple method called CORAL (for correlational alignment) that figures out how to transform C_s into C_t using some invertible mapping A. CORAL is popular as a transfer learning method in computer vision. But, CORAL does not actually use the knowledge that the space of positive definite matrices (or covariance matrices) forms a manifold. In fact, it forms something called a cone in convex analysis. If you subtract one covariance matrix from another, the result is not a covariance matrix. So, they do not form a vector space, but rather something else entirely. Oops, it turns out the study of cones is important in convex analysis, so there you go again, you need to learn about convex sets and functions, projections onto convex sets, etc. The dividing line between tractable and intractable optimization is not linear vs. nonlinear, but rather, convex vs. non-convex.

I hope the pattern is becoming clear. Like one of those legendary Russian dolls, where each time you open one, you find it is not the end, but there’s another one inside it, so it is with learning math in machine learning. Each time you learn a bit of math, you find it opens the door to an entirely new field of math, which you need to know something about as well. For my most recent paper, I had to digest a whole book devoted entirely to the topic of positive definite matrices (it’s like the old joke, where the deeper you go, the more you know about a specialized topic, until you know everything about —- nothing!).

Any given problem in machine learning, like transfer learning, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, as a manifold learning problem, as a multivariate statistical estimation problem, as a nonlinear gradient based deep learning problem, etc. etc. Each of these requires learning a bit about the underlying math involved.

If you feel discouraged, and feel like tearing your hair out at this point, I sympathize with you. But, on the other hand, you can look on the positive side, and realize that in terms of our analogy of running a marathon, you are steadily becoming better at running the long race, building your mathematical muscle as you go along, and gradually things start falling into place. Things start to make sense, and different subfields start connecting with each other. Something strange happens. You start liking it! Of course, there’s a drawback. Someone who doesn't understand any of the math you get good at using asks you to explain your work, and you realize that it’s impossible to do that without writing equations.

Most researchers find their comfort zone and try to stay within it, since otherwise, it takes a great deal of time and effort to master the dozens of mathematical subfields that modern ML uses. But, this strategy eventually fails, and one is always forced to get outside one’s comfort zone and learn some new math, since otherwise, a whole area of the field becomes alien to you.

Fortunately, the human brain is an amazing instrument, and provides decades and decades of trouble-free operation, allowing us to continually learn over 40,50, 60, years or more. How precisely it does that without zeroing out all prior learning is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science!",https://www.quora.com/How-does-machine-learning-work?top_ans=72758478,2018-02-10T22:34:01.177380+00:00,2018-02-13T10:03:28.965016+00:00,1302,Sridhar Mahadevan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6
What is the brutal truth about machine learning?,"Not really brutal but more of anti-climactic realities:

 * Most business datasets are either too dirty or too sparse to make machine learning useful.
 * The actual use-cases for machine learning are few vs. more general business analytics. Many business problems do not require prediction. Inferential statistics and variance analysis will take care of 80–90% of insighting.
 * Businesses value interpretability over accuracy. This is why less efficient but more interpretable methods (e.g. logistic/linear regression) are still in use over the black box methods that can hit 95%+ AR.
 * Even with machine learning in place, business leaders remain skeptical of error rates. This is a cognitive bias; people value successes of human decisions and magnify the admittedly fewer failures of machine learning. Look at the media firestorm on the few self-driving car mishaps vs. the thousands to millions of people dying due to other causes.
 * The use-cases where machine learning does shine (e.g. object detection, text analysis, sound analysis, image analysis) require relatively more mature and advanced business culture and process. This rules out 90+% of typical businesses. Over time the purported AI-driven companies will multiply in number and more and more research is making ML more relevant to every day tasks.
 * The hype cycle for ML is also conflating the problem: many tech companies and startups are branding conventional solutions as AI or ML, which increases confusion and skepticism amongst clients. This will take its time to subside and the real successful use-cases will emerge. For practitioners like us, this time can’t happen quick enough.

"What is machine learning, and how does it really work?","Think this way, as a child, if you are tasked to go from your house to school, your father would take you for a few days. Those times, you would not be completely confident to take the right route. After a few days, you will acquire confidence and would know the exact route to your school. Have you ever thought how you learnt to understand exact route to your school?

Your father had trained you initially, during which, you understood, the data points like Direction, Turn, Timing, etc., which will teach you well to reach school by exact time after a few days. How did you do that. Everyday you would do the task, you would try to correct yourself and try to become an expert at it. This wasn't a binary switch learning, but learning was a gradual process, wherein, your learning was probablistic.

This is the same way, algorithms are written, that read the data points, correct themselves to produce better outputs based on error rates.",https://www.quora.com/How-does-machine-learning-work?top_ans=55427636,2017-09-02T02:35:03.277869+00:00,,5,Adarsh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Adarsh-153
How would you suggest learning data science?,"It depends on where you are starting from. But generally if you want to learn data science with the goal of being a data scientist then you have to be patient and chip away at what you need to learn. There is a host of things that you will need and it will take time to learn it all. It can take anywhere from 6 months to several years to level up to where you need to be.

1. Start learning python and sql now. You need to be intermediate/advanced in python or R and at least average in sql to get a data science job. Start with a few hours every day and don't let your lack od good coding skills stop you from moving onto the next steps. The coding expertise will come if you hammer away at it every day for 6 months.
2. You need an equivalent of first year graduate level applied statistics. From basic applied stats with p values and anovas through linear regression and up to experimental design and the host of different sampling methodologies. Get some books or take some classes and put in a few hours every week.
3. You need basic calculus and linear algebra to understand the machine learning models and how to code them. Take these classes right away.
4. You need to learn the most common machine learning algorithms from logistic regression, decision trees, up through xgboost and a host of others. Choose a different algorithm every other week and study it and see if you can't use each type in a toy project at first.
5. You need to learn some basic data visualization and presentation tools. Python has some ok libraries but most people go with something like Tableau.
These will get you 90% of the way there and you can fill up the last 10% with things like hadoop, hive, and spark. This could also be filled with deep learning and more advanced tools. Some command line knowledge usually helps, as well as experience with some online tools like Azure or AWS. Fill in the gaps with what is hot in the job specs when you start applying.

In the end everything will build to you demonstrating with at least two full end to end projects that you can take ownership of to showcase all your skills and knowledge of the data science and machine learning workflow. Showcase what you know by starting two projects from scratch by coming up with a good idea, getting or scraping the data yourself, sourcing and cleaning the data, analyzing it, modeling it, and putting it into production with a web app or dashboard. Or at least a great presentation or paper to show your work and conclusions.

Great resources for aspiring data scientists can be found all over the web. Look to places like Kaggle and DataCamp to get started. Both are designed for the beginner and advanced. Almost everything Kaggle offers for beginners is gold and free. And DataCamp has tons of quick classes for a small yearly fee that will quickly build your confidence with coding for data science basics.

If you are not someone who can do this all on your own then look to bootcamps and masters programs to get you headed in the right direction. In the end there are many different ways to gain the knowledge to get an end to end data science project under your belt. Once you do you will be ready to start interviewing.

Good luck.",https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-learn-before-data-science?top_ans=232587436,2020-08-11T06:28:09.687282+00:00,,8,Damon Resnick,https://www.quora.com/profile/Damon-Resnick
How would you suggest learning data science?,"I’d suggest a formal education, if possible, even if it’s in another science. The math is quite difficult to learn well on your own, and it’s easy to mis-apply machine learning algorithms or sample incorrectly. This creates problems for companies when incorrect methods lead to incorrect information upon which they’re acting.

If you’re in a country without formal education opportunities, there are many good micro-degrees these days, and with the COVID era now, it’s easy to find online conferences with unpaid/paid workshops in different areas (Spark, NLP…). I’d recommend Data Science Africa’s conferences, as well as the tutorials/notebooks that they keep in a repository. Many paid workshops aren’t horribly expensive compared to college (usually $300-$800 for 2+ days of training), and it’s possible to pick up skills at them.

However, an undergraduate in IT or science coupled with those methods is still preferable (particularly in getting hired).

Which maths topics should I learn before learning data science?,"The data science role has declined for three straight years now.

When it declines in 2020, it will be the fourth year the role declines in the real-world.

Data science is dead. Read this for a wake up call. [ https://www.quora.com/Is-the-data-scientist-job-still-trending-on-the-number-1-job-in-the-world/answer/Mike-West-99 ]

So, the real question is… how do I become a machine learning engineer?

Firstly, ignore just about every one of the comments here.

Math is the single most OVERRATED SKILL for those in the applied space.

Machine learning is PROGRAMMING.

Here are a few real-world interview questions.  [ https://www.quora.com/What-types-of-technical-questions-are-most-commonly-asked-in-Senior-Machine-Learning-Engineer-interviews/answer/Mike-West-99 ]None of them are math related.

Here’s a pic of the end to end ML pipeline.

If you can’t walk into an interview and work through the end to end process most companies won’t be paying you the big coin associated with this field.

It’s only 4 boxes, looks easy but not so much. Here’s what you’ll need to be able to do.

1. Sit with the business types to define the problem.
2. Ensure you have the data for their problem.
3. Source the data. Have the SQL skills to create the code to be able to pull it from relational databases. If you can’t craft multi-table joins then we pass on you. We… and most companies… now require 3–5 years real-world SQL experience.
4. Wrangle and cleanse data. Again, heavy data experience required. Additionally, you’ll need to know the stats and the “why” to cleansing your data. For example, why is a normal distribution important? If the data is not normally distributed, what can you do? New to data wrangling?
5. We build our models in GCP and AWS so basic cloud skills are required.
6. Be able to choose a model type then build and tune that model. If most real world models are supervised (and they are), what modeling approach might you choose and why? Again, if you don’t know that almost all the structured dataset competitions are dominated by gradient boosters then that’s a problem. Note: Stay away from deep learning for now. Most real world modeling is done on structured data, another class of models called gradient boosters works much better than ANNs. Almost all my work is on structured datasets. We only use gradient boosters.
7. Work with front end types or author the front end code to call your model. Your model is useless if it’s not being consumed.
8. Monitor the performance of your models.
You get the idea.

So, how do you get started?

1. You need to gain real-world experience working with data. Get a job working with SQL now.
2. Learn Python and the core ML libraries.
3. Be able to work the end to end ML pipeline.
4. Learn applied stats.
5. Set realistic expectations. If you are new with no IT background you are looking at 8 years before you are in a real-world job.
6. Because a voracious learner of all things applied machine learning.
7. Enter a Kaggle and score high. Be able to explain how you scored this well in great technical detail.

What should I learn first: data science or machine learning?,"Data science is being able to play around with data and drawing useful insights. Data science involves many tools beyond Machine Learning such as exploratory data analysis, querying / slicing and dicing data.

Machine learning is a subset of data science that involves predictive modelling / “learning” from data without pre-programmed rules.

What to focus on first depends on what you want to do after that :

If you want to do academic research in ML for instance, you might not need a lot of tools and techniques for data wrangling and exploratory data analysis - i.e data science tools and concepts outside machine learning.

In an real-world , industry setting, it is important to be comfortable handling data (sometimes big data) before even applying ML techniques or deciding what ML techniques to apply. So you will need both these skills - and might make sense to learn data science and be comfortable with data before learning to apply ML techniques.

Which maths topics should I learn before learning data science?,"Hi There!!

Essential Math Skills for Data Science ,Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence are,

1. Statistics and Probability

Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Bayes’ Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation

2. Multivariable Calculus

Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function

3. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors

4. Optimization Methods

Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm)

How can I learn data science given that I have zero knowledge of it?,"As other answers have already mentioned, there are a variety of things one must learn to become a proficient data scientist - programming languages such as R or Python, statistics, linear algebra, databases, the list goes on.

Instead of rehashing those answers, I’d like to focus on the life cycle of a data scientist, and the steps you’ll need to master in order to excel in your job.

Data Gathering

Unless you’re at a company with great data governance you’re likely going to have some trouble accessing the data you want. Whether thats because your company has neglected to put the necessary systems in place to gather data, or the data that they are collecting is fragmented and scattered across the organization, you’ll have to first spend some time gathering whatever data you’ll need to do your job. That means having discussions with relevant stakeholders, and getting the necessary credentials to access databases within your organization.

Data Preparation

Once you have access to data, you’ll need to spend some time cleaning and formatting it. This is where Data Science can often become more of an art, then a science. Unlike datasets you’ll find in competitions, the real world has very messy data sets. Missing values, error in data collection, data formatting, normalization, outliers - these are all issues that you’ll have to learn to deal with.

Exploration

Before diving into building any models, you’ll want to explore the data to try to glean some insights. Clustering algorithms, scatterplots, bar graphs, Chernoff faces are all interesting ways of visualizing data that will lead to a better understanding of the structure of your data and aid you in your model building step.

Model Building

With your data cleaned and formatted, you’ll have an opportunity to explore a variety of models to see which one works best. Random Forests, SVM’s, Bayesian Predictors Neural Networks, Deep Learning, K-Nearest Neighbours - all models you should familiarize yourself with. There is no one model fits all, and so you again will need to develop intuition on which model suits your particular problem.

Model Validation

Prediction accuracy is a common benchmark for whether your model is performing well, however often times there are other things to consider. False positives and false negatives are important to think about from the perspective of the problem you’re working on. If you’re predicting disease, you’ll care more about minimizing false negative, since it may result in a persons death - whereas a false positive will only lead to additional testing.

Model Deployment

Finally you’ll deploy your model into the wild, as you gather more data and feedback on how its doing you’ll be able to tweak and improve it as time goes on.

This is by no means a comprehensive list of steps, and there are certainly other things you’ll need to do to be able to do well in your job - however this is a good high level overview of the steps involved in tackling data science problems.",https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-learn-before-data-science?top_ans=67537674,2017-12-25T01:58:38.285201+00:00,2017-12-25T02:03:36.172967+00:00,2,Andrei Lyskov,https://www.quora.com/profile/Andrei-Lyskov-1
What are the key skills of a data scientist?,"Truth be told first - even if it disappoints many people -the industry does not have an agreed upon definition of a data scientist! 

Jokes like 'a data scientist is a data analyst living in the Silicon Valley' are abundant. Below is one such cartoon, just for fun.



Finding an 'effective' data scientist is hard and finding people who understand who a data scientist is equally hard. Note the use of 'effective' here, I use it to highlight that there could be people who might possess some of these skills yet may not be the best fit in a data science role. Irony is that even the people looking for hiring data scientists do not know who a data scientist is. Hiring managers post job descriptions for traditional data analyst and business analyst roles while the title calling it a 'Data Scientist' role.  

Everything that I say below is my experience working in a data scientist role with a major search engine and advertising platform. Instead of giving a bullet list of skills, I would first highlight the difference between some data related roles. 

Consider the following scenario. Shop-Mart and Bulk-Mart are two competitors in selling retail. Some higher up in the management chain asks this question: ""How many Shop-Mart customers also go to Bulk-Mart?"". 

[Please note that the question might be of interest to Bulk-Mart management or even a third party, possibly a market research or consumer behavior company, interested in shopping behavior of the population.]



Here is how different data-related roles will approach the problem. This 

Traditional BI/Reporting Professional: Generate reports from structured data using SQL and some kind of reporting services (SSRS for instance) and send the data back to management. The management asks more questions based on the data that was sent and cycle continues. Insights about data are most likely not included in the reports. A person in this role will be experienced mostly in database related skills.

Data Analyst: In addition to doing what the BI guy did, a data analyst will also keep other factors like seasonality, segmentation and visualization in mind. What about if certain trends in shopping behavior are tied to seasonality? What if the trends are different across gender, demographics, geography, product category? A data analyst will slice and dice the data to understand and annotate the report with it. Besides database skills, a data analyst will have a understanding of some of the common visualization tools.

Business Analyst: A business analyst possess the skills that the BI and data analysts have plus domain knowledge and understanding of the business. A business analyst may also have some basic skills in forecasting etc.

Data Mining or Big Data Engineer: Do what the data analyst did, possibly from unstructured data if needed. MapReduce and other big data skills may be needed. Understands the common issues in running jobs on large scale data and is able to debug the jobs. 

Statistician (A traditional one): Pull the data from a DB or obtain it from any of the roles mentioned above and run appropriate statistical tests. Ensure the quality of data and correctness of the conclusions by using standard practices like choosing the right sample size, confidence level, level of significance, type of test etc. 
The situation has changed a bit recently. Statistics departments at most schools have evolved in way that statisticians graduate with strong programming and decent foundation skills in CS enabling them to do the tasks that statisticians traditionally were not trained in.

Program/Project Manager: Look at the data provided by the professionals mentioned so far, align business with the findings and influence the leadership to take appropriate action. Possesses communication skills, presentation skills and can influence without authority.
Ironically the person a PM is influencing business decisions using the data and insights provided by others. If the person does not have a knack for understanding data, chances are that the person will not be able to influence others to take the correct decisions. 


Now putting it altogether.

The rise of online services has brought a paradigm shift in software development life cycle and how business iterate over successive features and products. Having a different data puller, analyst, statistician and project manager is just now possible any more. The mantra now is ship, experiment and learn, adapt, ship, experiment and learn .... This situation has resulted in the birth of a new role - ' A Data Scientist'

A data scientist should have the skills of all the individuals I have mentioned so far. In addition to the skills mentioned above, a data scientist should have rapid prototyping and programming, machine learning, visualization and hacking skills. 

Domain Knowledge and Soft Skills Are As Important as Technical Skills:
The importance of domain knowledge and soft skills like communication and influencing without authority are severely under-estimated both by hiring managers and aspiring data scientists. Insights without domain knowledge can potentially mislead the consumers of these insights. Correct insights without the ability to influence the decision making is as bad as having no insights.

All of what I have said above is based on my own tenure as a data scientist at a major search engine and later the advertising platform within the same company. I learnt that sometimes people asking the question may not know what they want to know - sounds preposterous - yet happens way too often. Very often a bozo will start rat holing into something that is not related to the issue at hand - just to prove that he/she is relevant. A data scientist encounters such HIPPOS (Highly Paid Person's Opinion) that are somewhat unrelated to the problem if not complete nonsense very often. A data scientist should posses the right soft skills to manage situations where people ask irrelevant, distracting or outside of scope questions. This is hard, especially in situations where the person asking the question is several levels up in the corporate ladder and is known to have an ego. It is a data scientist's responsibility to manage up and around while presenting and communicating insights. 

Below is a summary of necessary skills a data scientist should possess in my opinion.

Curiosity About Data and Passion for Domain: If you are not passionate about the domain/business and curious about  data then it is unlikely that you will succeed in a data scientist role. If you are working as a data scientist with an online retailer, you should be hungry all the time to crunch and munch from the Smörgåsbord (of data of course) to know more. If your curiosity does not keep you awake, no skill in the world can help you succeed. 

Soft Skills: Communication and influencing without authority. Understanding of what is the minimum that has the maximum impact. Too many findings are as bad as no findings at all.   Ability to scoop information out of partners and customers, even from the unwilling ones is extremely important. The data you are looking for may not be sitting in one single place. You may have to beg, borrow, steal and do whatever it takes to get the data.

Being a good story teller is also something that helps. Sometimes the insights obtained from data are counter-intuitive, if you are not a good story teller, it will be difficult to convince your audience.

Math/Theory: Machine Learning. Stats and Probability 101. Optimization would be icing on the cake.

CS/Programming: At least one scripting language (I prefer python). Decent algorithms and DS skills, to be able to write code that can analyze a lot of data efficiently. You may not be a production code developer but should be able write code that does not suck. Database management and SQL skills. Knowledge of a statistical computing package, most people including myself prefer R. A spread sheet software like excel.

Big Data and Distributed Systems: Understanding of basic MapReduce concepts, Hadoop and Hadoop file system and least one language like Hive/Pig. Some companies have their own proprietary implementations of these languages. Knowledge of tools like Mahout and any of the xaaS like Azure and AWS would be helpful. Once again big companies have their own xaaS so you may be working on variants of any of these.

Visualization: Ability to create simple yet elegant and meaningful visualization. In my case, R packages like ggplot, lattice and others have helped me in most cases but there are other packages that you can use. In some cases, you might want to use D3. 


Below is a visualization of high level description of skills needed to become a data scientist.


Where is a data scientist in the big data pipeline?
Here is a nice visualization of the big data pipeline, the associated technologies and the regions of operation. In general the depiction of where the data scientist belongs in this pipeline is largely correct, there is one caveat however. A data scientist should be comfortable to dive into the 'Collect' and 'Store' territories if needed. Usually  data scientists would be working on transformed data and beyond but in scenarios where the business does cannot afford to wait for the transformation process to complete, a data scientist has to turn to raw data to gather insights.

What things do I need to learn to become a data scientist?,"Learning never ends in such fields,the more you experience the different tools and technology, the better you will be.Data science or any computer science oriented field will be strong only when you experienced it practically.You don’t have to worry much at the beginning,The only thing you have to do is to choose a language(R/Python) to start with,which you are comfortable at.

If you do not have any knowledge about what to choose,Then :

Which technology should I choose?

Python

Python is one of the world’s most popular programming languages. Whether you want to build a website or a machine learning model, Python can get you there! Here are a few highlights of the language:

 * General purpose programming language (can be used to make anything)
 * Easy to read and write (and learn!)
 * One of the most popular languages for data science
 * Preferred by computer scientists and programmers
 * Language of choice for cutting edge machine learning and AI applications
 * Commonly used for putting models ""in production""
R

R is one of the most popular languages in the world for data science. Built specifically for working with data, R provides an intuitive interface to the most advanced statistical methods available today. Here are a few highlights of the language:

 * Built specifically for data analysis and visualization
 * One of the most popular languages for data science
 * Preferred by statisticians and academic researchers
 * Language of choice for cutting edge statistics
 * Vast collection of community-contributed packages
 * Rapid prototyping of data-driven apps and dashboards
After you decided the language to continue with,Just be good at that language basics and begin with basic Data science concepts:

 * Data Import/Export

 * Data Manipulation
 * Statistics For Data Science
After enough of practice of Data Science Concept you can then move to machine learning algorithms.

 * Supervised Learning
 * 
 * Classification
 * Regression

 * Unsupervised Learning
 * 
 * Clustering
 * Association

After having all the concepts,You will clearly get the Idea of what to do next and don’t forget to practice enough the concepts.You can further explore other concepts like Time Series Analysis,Applied Finance,etc according to your Interest.",https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-learn-before-data-science?top_ans=78304389,2018-04-02T15:25:31.922750+00:00,,8,Ujjwal Vats,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ujjwal-Vats-8

Which math topics should I learn before I start learning Machine Learning + Data Science?,"From the list you provided, the most important topics in my opinion are:

1. Probability and Statistics
2. Linear Algebra
3. (****) Calculus
Probability and Statistics are the basics of machine learning and data science and there are probabilities and statistical models every where. By knowing the statistics, you should be able to use programming languages like R or Python to build a simple model (using built-in functions) like linear regression and logistic regressions and would be able to interpret the meanings (i.e. interpretation, model fit, standard error, etc.).

To dig deeper into the algorithms behind those models, you will need linear algebra and calculus (whatever kind of) to understand least squares, maximum likelihood estimation, etc.

For resources, I believe you can just simply Google and find a lot of course notes or online courses. You can also refer to: How can I become a data scientist?

"I am 25 years old, is it too late for me to start learning data analytics?","Thanks for asking this question. I’d love to know why you think 25 is too late to learn something new? The Analytics Accelerator Certification has learners mostly in the age range from 28 years to 58 years. And yes, there are at least 10% of learners globally who are well above 40 years of age.

Now for my story, in case it helps. I started learning Analytics at age 37 with two kids. I left a job to do this and with some luck and a lot of work, I am consulting in Analytics projects now apart from teaching Analytics at International Universities and online as a hobby.

I wrote a blog on my journey that you may like to read. What is a self-made data scientist? [ https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-self-made-data-scientist ]

Start and study with interest and an eye to apply. You will, of course, do well. Your best years have not even started. People peak at 35 to 45 years of age. You have 10 years to your peak. So set yourself up well.

What are the mathematical topics that need to learn before starting data science course?,"The Best way to get ready for Data Science is to start with Statistics. There will be a lot of terms used in Statistics that you should be knowing before starting and such course. If it already includes such introduction then great.

You also should be familiar with topics like Linear Algebra and Calculus.

It'll be very helpful if you know some data analytic languages like R/Python/Matlab.

Whatever I suggested can also be done along with your course. So choose wisely, and make best use of your time.

But remember, Practice it, Solve problems, and try to make sense of Data.

What should I learn first: data science or machine learning?,"Honestly? Don't listen to those who recommend you to start with ML. Unless it's an Andrew Ng's or similar course, you will end up with huge gaps in statistics, and statistics is one of the keys to being a data scientist. It helps to view ML as automation of statistical and computational procedures that you use to gain insights and predictions from your data.",https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-learn-before-data-science?top_ans=169061328,2019-09-21T14:21:40.624560+00:00,,8,Alex Gilgur,https://www.quora.com/profile/Alex-Gilgur

How can I learn data science as a beginner?,"Data Science being a science, is a pretty huge field. The answer is my personal perception of how to start your journey.

Firstly, it is important to understand what data science means and the different fields that come together to form it. When I started my learning path in Data Science, I had no shape or form. I went through a lot of courses and materials that had no connections whatsover. I know there are a lot of courses out there that teach data science from the basics, but this is a course that I would recommend for a beginner (Data Science 101 [ https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-science-101/ ]). This is a completely non-technical introduction to Data Science in general. You will realize the myriad of problems where these techniques are applied.

Once you are done with an informal introduction to the field (the course should help you make a decision whether you want to be in this field or not), it is important to dive into the primary technical components of the data science workflow - statistics and a little bit of programming (preferably Python or R). I personally use Python because I am accustomed to it, but does not really make a difference which language you choose. I do not have any links to direct you to learn programming for data science at stuff, but it would be enough for a beginner to use loops, conditional statements, functions, and basic functions from other libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and MatplotLib. I have a couple of recommendations for statistics classes that are free online, and one of these is taught by Sebastian Thrun, the co-founder of Udacity (Intro to Statistics [ https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101/ ]) and the other is taught by Murtaza Haider, an associate professor at Ryerson University, Canada (Statistics 101 [ https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/statistics-101/ ]). I prefer the course by Sebastian Thrun because does not have much to do with programming languages and has a lot of hand calculations.

Coming to programming, you just need to know some functions on how to read a data set, display each row, summarize each column (variable), etc. If you are into data science, you must be familiar with the UCI’s Machine Learning repository (UCI Machine Learning Repository: Data Sets [ http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html ]). Take your own data set - anything you find intriguing that will push you spend some time one. Realize one small thing before you start. An analysis has no end game. Take one row and compare it with the other to see how a numerical/categorical different impacts the target value, visualize the range of values for each variable using various graphs, spend some time writing/recording your results at each and every step - why do you think a variable A depends on other variable H, ask a question whether these variables depend on each other in the real-world, or is their relationship confined to the data you are working on, etc. Data Science is not just about asking the right questions, it is also about framing the question in an understandable way.

Once you are done with primary analysis of data, you have now grown a bit in this field. It is important to make predictions to propel your insights to the real world. Consider taking Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course (Machine Learning | Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning ]). If you successfully complete this course, follow the next steps as given in this answer (Prudhvi Raj's answer to Where should I start from after the Andrew Ng Machine Learning course from Coursera? [ https://www.quora.com/Where-should-I-start-from-after-the-Andrew-Ng-Machine-Learning-course-from-Coursera/answer/Prudhvi-Raj-114 ])

I hope this helps and you will begin your journey into the world of Data Science.",https://www.quora.com/What-things-do-I-need-to-learn-to-become-a-data-science-pro?top_ans=52621428,2017-08-05T11:31:14.775386+00:00,,229,Prudhvi Raj,https://www.quora.com/profile/Prudhvi-Raj-114
What things do I need to learn to become a data science pro?,"Data Science, as a discipline, sits at the intersection of a lot of skills. A data scientist can mean a variety of skillsets. To be a pro, you need to master a subset of those skillsets.

Listing everything is not productive since it'll always be aspirational and may lead to a sense of inadequacy. Be a jack of many things and a master of may be a couple of things. That's good enough for being a pro.

That said, there are a couple of things every data scientist needs to master to become a pro. If you are new to data science, start by learning

1. Statistics
2. A language like R or Python or something similar
3. Machine Learning (optional), if you feel ready for it
To become a pro, you need to master the first two, and then a few other skills depending on where your interests take you.",https://www.quora.com/What-things-do-I-need-to-learn-to-become-a-data-science-pro?top_ans=83908118,2018-05-18T15:06:22.605670+00:00,,0,Soumendra Prasad Dhanee,https://www.quora.com/profile/Soumendra-Prasad-Dhanee
What are the key skills of a data scientist?,"Truth be told first - even if it disappoints many people -the industry does not have an agreed upon definition of a data scientist! 

Jokes like 'a data scientist is a data analyst living in the Silicon Valley' are abundant. Below is one such cartoon, just for fun.



Finding an 'effective' data scientist is hard and finding people who understand who a data scientist is equally hard. Note the use of 'effective' here, I use it to highlight that there could be people who might possess some of these skills yet may not be the best fit in a data science role. Irony is that even the people looking for hiring data scientists do not know who a data scientist is. Hiring managers post job descriptions for traditional data analyst and business analyst roles while the title calling it a 'Data Scientist' role.  

Everything that I say below is my experience working in a data scientist role with a major search engine and advertising platform. Instead of giving a bullet list of skills, I would first highlight the difference between some data related roles. 

Consider the following scenario. Shop-Mart and Bulk-Mart are two competitors in selling retail. Some higher up in the management chain asks this question: ""How many Shop-Mart customers also go to Bulk-Mart?"". 

[Please note that the question might be of interest to Bulk-Mart management or even a third party, possibly a market research or consumer behavior company, interested in shopping behavior of the population.]



Here is how different data-related roles will approach the problem. This 

Traditional BI/Reporting Professional: Generate reports from structured data using SQL and some kind of reporting services (SSRS for instance) and send the data back to management. The management asks more questions based on the data that was sent and cycle continues. Insights about data are most likely not included in the reports. A person in this role will be experienced mostly in database related skills.

Data Analyst: In addition to doing what the BI guy did, a data analyst will also keep other factors like seasonality, segmentation and visualization in mind. What about if certain trends in shopping behavior are tied to seasonality? What if the trends are different across gender, demographics, geography, product category? A data analyst will slice and dice the data to understand and annotate the report with it. Besides database skills, a data analyst will have a understanding of some of the common visualization tools.

Business Analyst: A business analyst possess the skills that the BI and data analysts have plus domain knowledge and understanding of the business. A business analyst may also have some basic skills in forecasting etc.

Data Mining or Big Data Engineer: Do what the data analyst did, possibly from unstructured data if needed. MapReduce and other big data skills may be needed. Understands the common issues in running jobs on large scale data and is able to debug the jobs. 

Statistician (A traditional one): Pull the data from a DB or obtain it from any of the roles mentioned above and run appropriate statistical tests. Ensure the quality of data and correctness of the conclusions by using standard practices like choosing the right sample size, confidence level, level of significance, type of test etc. 
The situation has changed a bit recently. Statistics departments at most schools have evolved in way that statisticians graduate with strong programming and decent foundation skills in CS enabling them to do the tasks that statisticians traditionally were not trained in.

Program/Project Manager: Look at the data provided by the professionals mentioned so far, align business with the findings and influence the leadership to take appropriate action. Possesses communication skills, presentation skills and can influence without authority.
Ironically the person a PM is influencing business decisions using the data and insights provided by others. If the person does not have a knack for understanding data, chances are that the person will not be able to influence others to take the correct decisions. 


Now putting it altogether.

The rise of online services has brought a paradigm shift in software development life cycle and how business iterate over successive features and products. Having a different data puller, analyst, statistician and project manager is just now possible any more. The mantra now is ship, experiment and learn, adapt, ship, experiment and learn .... This situation has resulted in the birth of a new role - ' A Data Scientist'

A data scientist should have the skills of all the individuals I have mentioned so far. In addition to the skills mentioned above, a data scientist should have rapid prototyping and programming, machine learning, visualization and hacking skills. 

Domain Knowledge and Soft Skills Are As Important as Technical Skills:
The importance of domain knowledge and soft skills like communication and influencing without authority are severely under-estimated both by hiring managers and aspiring data scientists. Insights without domain knowledge can potentially mislead the consumers of these insights. Correct insights without the ability to influence the decision making is as bad as having no insights.

All of what I have said above is based on my own tenure as a data scientist at a major search engine and later the advertising platform within the same company. I learnt that sometimes people asking the question may not know what they want to know - sounds preposterous - yet happens way too often. Very often a bozo will start rat holing into something that is not related to the issue at hand - just to prove that he/she is relevant. A data scientist encounters such HIPPOS (Highly Paid Person's Opinion) that are somewhat unrelated to the problem if not complete nonsense very often. A data scientist should posses the right soft skills to manage situations where people ask irrelevant, distracting or outside of scope questions. This is hard, especially in situations where the person asking the question is several levels up in the corporate ladder and is known to have an ego. It is a data scientist's responsibility to manage up and around while presenting and communicating insights. 

Below is a summary of necessary skills a data scientist should possess in my opinion.

Curiosity About Data and Passion for Domain: If you are not passionate about the domain/business and curious about  data then it is unlikely that you will succeed in a data scientist role. If you are working as a data scientist with an online retailer, you should be hungry all the time to crunch and munch from the Smörgåsbord (of data of course) to know more. If your curiosity does not keep you awake, no skill in the world can help you succeed. 

Soft Skills: Communication and influencing without authority. Understanding of what is the minimum that has the maximum impact. Too many findings are as bad as no findings at all.   Ability to scoop information out of partners and customers, even from the unwilling ones is extremely important. The data you are looking for may not be sitting in one single place. You may have to beg, borrow, steal and do whatever it takes to get the data.

Being a good story teller is also something that helps. Sometimes the insights obtained from data are counter-intuitive, if you are not a good story teller, it will be difficult to convince your audience.

Math/Theory: Machine Learning. Stats and Probability 101. Optimization would be icing on the cake.

CS/Programming: At least one scripting language (I prefer python). Decent algorithms and DS skills, to be able to write code that can analyze a lot of data efficiently. You may not be a production code developer but should be able write code that does not suck. Database management and SQL skills. Knowledge of a statistical computing package, most people including myself prefer R. A spread sheet software like excel.

Big Data and Distributed Systems: Understanding of basic MapReduce concepts, Hadoop and Hadoop file system and least one language like Hive/Pig. Some companies have their own proprietary implementations of these languages. Knowledge of tools like Mahout and any of the xaaS like Azure and AWS would be helpful. Once again big companies have their own xaaS so you may be working on variants of any of these.

Visualization: Ability to create simple yet elegant and meaningful visualization. In my case, R packages like ggplot, lattice and others have helped me in most cases but there are other packages that you can use. In some cases, you might want to use D3. 


Below is a visualization of high level description of skills needed to become a data scientist.


Where is a data scientist in the big data pipeline?
Here is a nice visualization of the big data pipeline, the associated technologies and the regions of operation. In general the depiction of where the data scientist belongs in this pipeline is largely correct, there is one caveat however. A data scientist should be comfortable to dive into the 'Collect' and 'Store' territories if needed. Usually  data scientists would be working on transformed data and beyond but in scenarios where the business does cannot afford to wait for the transformation process to complete, a data scientist has to turn to raw data to gather insights.

What can I learn in one day that will significantly improve my data science career?,"Match Communication Styles

Creating business or scientific value from data is essentially mastery of 3 things:

 * Data - where to source it, what kind of data is needed, how to store and transform it.
 * Insight - creating algorithms, models, simulations from data to unearth patterns and trends as well as visualizations and representations to convey them.
 * Action - making a recommendation from the patterns unearthed from data - whether it’s a process change, a new app or product, automating a manual process, or an intelligent assistant to guide people with decision making.
The 1-day lifehack is understanding the sequence to communicate this to an audience. Most of us in the data profession will communicate these concepts in the order that we execute and process them, that is:

Data -%3E Insight -%3E Action

This actually works well if we are dealing with peers or more junior apprentices who want to learn how we came to our results. However, if you are talking to decision makers and senior staff, it’s the opposite order that makes more sense:

Action -%3E Insight -%3E Data

This is because decision-makers need to know immediately what to do and rarely have time to inquire about the process. Consider the following statements about the same topic, but geared towards 2 different audiences:

“I got our dataset of loan customers including the defaulters for the past 24 months and ran the data through a process of classification involving Logistic Regression to determine the likelihood of default for each customer to an accuracy of 85%. From the results I determined the ideal cutoff score is 750 if we want to keep default rates below 5%.”

Or:

“I recommend we set our cutoff score to 750, which corresponds to a maximum default rate of 5%. We derived this using a Logistic Regression model on our loan customer data over the last 24 months with an Accuracy Rate of 85%.”

If you mismatch communication styles, it can have negative effects. For example you will bore a decision-maker if you go D-%3EI-%3EA and they will tune out before you get to the A. On the flip side if you go A-%3EI-%3ED to peers, they may not respect your findings since you didn’t explain your process first. Of course exceptions occur, but I found it’s a good rule of thumb to keep in mind.",https://www.quora.com/What-things-do-I-need-to-learn-to-become-a-data-science-pro?top_ans=99562096,2018-09-15T02:54:01.062970+00:00,,14,Dominic Ligot,https://www.quora.com/profile/Dominic-Ligot

Understand why companies want to use data science, how they already collect data and how you can make use of that data to make significant changes in the business.

You have to understand different business use-cases, for example:

 * If the business is not in profit, can you analyze the historical data, find existing problems and bring the business back in profit?
 * If the business wants more customers, can you find hidden patterns on the product features that your existing customers love, and make sure features more exciting or important?
 * If the business wants to cut costs, can you devise a way to use data science and tell exact areas where the existing cost is irrelevant?
There are just examples, and you may find very different examples in the real world than what is stated here. The point is to find the hidden pattern within the business to understand where data science might help!

I don’t know where this can be solved in a day or not, but you could always try! :)

Cheers.

What can I learn in one day that will significantly improve my data science career?,"Contrary to the advice I’ve been reading for years, most practicing data scientists tend towards their favorite language and rarely leave room for any others.

For example, those using R always seem to make their ML pipeline work in production without converting into a more suitable language — and it does, but not without unneeded headaches.

Similarly, Python users like to data mine and prototype statistical models in Python, even if there are more productive dependencies (or lack thereof) to get the job done faster in R.

Additionally, those who have been using SAS longer than the millennial generation of data scientists have even been out of grade school rarely like to experiment with other languages.

Regardless, it seems data scientists feel they owe their analytical success to the language in which they’ve been most productive with historically, instilling a certain loyalty to this language.

I say that’s ridiculous, and although I’ve been guilty of this myself, I encourage everyone to experiment with more than just their favorite language.

For every project you work on, convert one or more tasks into another program. With enough conversions, you’ll begin to fall in love with other languages the same way you fell in love with your favorite.",https://www.quora.com/What-things-do-I-need-to-learn-to-become-a-data-science-pro?top_ans=141619272,2019-05-17T13:35:37.332095+00:00,,45,Jon Wayland,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jon-Wayland
What do I need to know to become a data scientist?,"If you want to stand out, widen your lens beyond algorithms. Most data scientists nowadays start out learning how to program classifiers, regressions, and deep learning using R or Python - and voila a data scientist is born. In reality analytics is a small part of the process of transforming data into real actionable value.

Once you’re comfy with algorithms - learn about the rest of the data value chain. Learn ingestion of data from multiple sources, how to store and warehouse data effectively using ETL tools, streaming, and databases - this knowledge of data engineering will help you be more effective in setting up data to respond to problems that your algos will solve. The latter leg is application development - learn how to package your algo into an app or productized report that will help non-technical users interact with and understand your work. This can be a simple d3.js or R-shiny automated visual to a full blown web app.

Algorithms are powerful, but expanding your knowledge beyond just the analytical part will make you more useful to others.

Data processes aside, the most useful knowledge is something you learn over time - domain experience with various businesses or scientific problems.

In business, some common functional areas for advanced analytics are in marketing, finance, risk management, operations, and networks. There are also nuances between industries like banking, telecoms, media, retail, manufacturing, power. If you are more of the academic researcher - most scientific fields have big data problems to solve - like astrophysics, biology, even psychology - where it branches into market research and politics. Find an area you find interesting and see where your data knowledge can be put to use.

Algorithms, tools and platforms are most useful if the person handling them has practical experience using them to solve real problems.",https://www.quora.com/What-things-do-I-need-to-learn-to-become-a-data-science-pro?top_ans=50625003,2017-07-17T04:06:50.190560+00:00,,15,Dominic Ligot,https://www.quora.com/profile/Dominic-Ligot

What is easy to learn about Data Science?,"Looking at the question and I thought for a while (for like 5 minutes) and I have to say, I cannot really come up with anything that is easy to learn.

But what I can suggest is that in order to make your learning journey easier, you need to have a strong foundation in the following:

1 - Mathematics & Statistics: For mathematics, namely Linear Algebra and Calculus

2 - Understand Computer Architecture: Enough to understand how computer works in general, different components of computers.

3 - Data Management Principles: Of course we need to know how to manage data to have it at the right quality for analysis and machine learning.

Why I suggested the above is during my work, I always have to revisit these concepts in order to understand the complex concepts better.

So yes, the three above. :)",https://www.quora.com/What-things-do-I-need-to-learn-to-become-a-data-science-pro?top_ans=189227718,2019-12-31T02:05:50.867588+00:00,,3,Koo Ping Shung,https://www.quora.com/profile/Koo-Ping-Shung
What do I need to learn and do to build my career in data science?,"1. Be prepared to invest 10,000 hours(Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years [ http://norvig.com/21-days.html ]). Data science is a vast area and spans a lot of subjects like NLP, ML, statistics and programming languages.

What skills do I need to become a data scientist? How do I approach if I'm at zero levels?,"At zero level? You need to learn to read, count and type.

I don’t think you’re at zero level though.

If you’re not really at zero, be aware that data science is a low information term. No one agrees on what it means. There are data scientist jobs that I could apply for where they would laugh at me for matching the skill set so poorly. Yet my job title is ‘data scientist’ at Google, so some people would say that I have a legitimate claim to be called a data scientist (even if we don’t know what that means).

I have two answers.

First answer, based on resumes I see and interviews, learn more statistics. Sure, knowing about optimization algorithms and machine learning and big data is great, but if you don’t know what a confidence interval is, or can’t describe a sampling strategy, they aren’t going to be good at the kinds of data science that we do.

Second answer: Whatever it is that appeals to you about data science, learn that. If data science (to you) is coding machine learning algorithms in C++, get better at that. If you think it’s using ggplot2 in R, do more of that. If you become a ‘data scientist’ but a data scientist doesn’t do what you want to do, that would not be idea.",https://www.quora.com/What-things-do-I-need-to-learn-to-become-a-data-science-pro?top_ans=115304623,2019-01-01T19:34:26.547478+00:00,,16,Jeremy Miles,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jeremy-Miles
What are the key skills of a data scientist?,"Truth be told first - even if it disappoints many people -the industry does not have an agreed upon definition of a data scientist! 

Jokes like 'a data scientist is a data analyst living in the Silicon Valley' are abundant. Below is one such cartoon, just for fun.



Finding an 'effective' data scientist is hard and finding people who understand who a data scientist is equally hard. Note the use of 'effective' here, I use it to highlight that there could be people who might possess some of these skills yet may not be the best fit in a data science role. Irony is that even the people looking for hiring data scientists do not know who a data scientist is. Hiring managers post job descriptions for traditional data analyst and business analyst roles while the title calling it a 'Data Scientist' role.  

Everything that I say below is my experience working in a data scientist role with a major search engine and advertising platform. Instead of giving a bullet list of skills, I would first highlight the difference between some data related roles. 

Consider the following scenario. Shop-Mart and Bulk-Mart are two competitors in selling retail. Some higher up in the management chain asks this question: ""How many Shop-Mart customers also go to Bulk-Mart?"". 

[Please note that the question might be of interest to Bulk-Mart management or even a third party, possibly a market research or consumer behavior company, interested in shopping behavior of the population.]



Here is how different data-related roles will approach the problem. This 

Traditional BI/Reporting Professional: Generate reports from structured data using SQL and some kind of reporting services (SSRS for instance) and send the data back to management. The management asks more questions based on the data that was sent and cycle continues. Insights about data are most likely not included in the reports. A person in this role will be experienced mostly in database related skills.

Data Analyst: In addition to doing what the BI guy did, a data analyst will also keep other factors like seasonality, segmentation and visualization in mind. What about if certain trends in shopping behavior are tied to seasonality? What if the trends are different across gender, demographics, geography, product category? A data analyst will slice and dice the data to understand and annotate the report with it. Besides database skills, a data analyst will have a understanding of some of the common visualization tools.

Business Analyst: A business analyst possess the skills that the BI and data analysts have plus domain knowledge and understanding of the business. A business analyst may also have some basic skills in forecasting etc.

Data Mining or Big Data Engineer: Do what the data analyst did, possibly from unstructured data if needed. MapReduce and other big data skills may be needed. Understands the common issues in running jobs on large scale data and is able to debug the jobs. 

Statistician (A traditional one): Pull the data from a DB or obtain it from any of the roles mentioned above and run appropriate statistical tests. Ensure the quality of data and correctness of the conclusions by using standard practices like choosing the right sample size, confidence level, level of significance, type of test etc. 
The situation has changed a bit recently. Statistics departments at most schools have evolved in way that statisticians graduate with strong programming and decent foundation skills in CS enabling them to do the tasks that statisticians traditionally were not trained in.

Program/Project Manager: Look at the data provided by the professionals mentioned so far, align business with the findings and influence the leadership to take appropriate action. Possesses communication skills, presentation skills and can influence without authority.
Ironically the person a PM is influencing business decisions using the data and insights provided by others. If the person does not have a knack for understanding data, chances are that the person will not be able to influence others to take the correct decisions. 


Now putting it altogether.

The rise of online services has brought a paradigm shift in software development life cycle and how business iterate over successive features and products. Having a different data puller, analyst, statistician and project manager is just now possible any more. The mantra now is ship, experiment and learn, adapt, ship, experiment and learn .... This situation has resulted in the birth of a new role - ' A Data Scientist'

A data scientist should have the skills of all the individuals I have mentioned so far. In addition to the skills mentioned above, a data scientist should have rapid prototyping and programming, machine learning, visualization and hacking skills. 

Domain Knowledge and Soft Skills Are As Important as Technical Skills:
The importance of domain knowledge and soft skills like communication and influencing without authority are severely under-estimated both by hiring managers and aspiring data scientists. Insights without domain knowledge can potentially mislead the consumers of these insights. Correct insights without the ability to influence the decision making is as bad as having no insights.

All of what I have said above is based on my own tenure as a data scientist at a major search engine and later the advertising platform within the same company. I learnt that sometimes people asking the question may not know what they want to know - sounds preposterous - yet happens way too often. Very often a bozo will start rat holing into something that is not related to the issue at hand - just to prove that he/she is relevant. A data scientist encounters such HIPPOS (Highly Paid Person's Opinion) that are somewhat unrelated to the problem if not complete nonsense very often. A data scientist should posses the right soft skills to manage situations where people ask irrelevant, distracting or outside of scope questions. This is hard, especially in situations where the person asking the question is several levels up in the corporate ladder and is known to have an ego. It is a data scientist's responsibility to manage up and around while presenting and communicating insights. 

Below is a summary of necessary skills a data scientist should possess in my opinion.

Curiosity About Data and Passion for Domain: If you are not passionate about the domain/business and curious about  data then it is unlikely that you will succeed in a data scientist role. If you are working as a data scientist with an online retailer, you should be hungry all the time to crunch and munch from the Smörgåsbord (of data of course) to know more. If your curiosity does not keep you awake, no skill in the world can help you succeed. 

Soft Skills: Communication and influencing without authority. Understanding of what is the minimum that has the maximum impact. Too many findings are as bad as no findings at all.   Ability to scoop information out of partners and customers, even from the unwilling ones is extremely important. The data you are looking for may not be sitting in one single place. You may have to beg, borrow, steal and do whatever it takes to get the data.

Being a good story teller is also something that helps. Sometimes the insights obtained from data are counter-intuitive, if you are not a good story teller, it will be difficult to convince your audience.

Math/Theory: Machine Learning. Stats and Probability 101. Optimization would be icing on the cake.

CS/Programming: At least one scripting language (I prefer python). Decent algorithms and DS skills, to be able to write code that can analyze a lot of data efficiently. You may not be a production code developer but should be able write code that does not suck. Database management and SQL skills. Knowledge of a statistical computing package, most people including myself prefer R. A spread sheet software like excel.

Big Data and Distributed Systems: Understanding of basic MapReduce concepts, Hadoop and Hadoop file system and least one language like Hive/Pig. Some companies have their own proprietary implementations of these languages. Knowledge of tools like Mahout and any of the xaaS like Azure and AWS would be helpful. Once again big companies have their own xaaS so you may be working on variants of any of these.

Visualization: Ability to create simple yet elegant and meaningful visualization. In my case, R packages like ggplot, lattice and others have helped me in most cases but there are other packages that you can use. In some cases, you might want to use D3. 


Below is a visualization of high level description of skills needed to become a data scientist.


Where is a data scientist in the big data pipeline?
Here is a nice visualization of the big data pipeline, the associated technologies and the regions of operation. In general the depiction of where the data scientist belongs in this pipeline is largely correct, there is one caveat however. A data scientist should be comfortable to dive into the 'Collect' and 'Store' territories if needed. Usually  data scientists would be working on transformed data and beyond but in scenarios where the business does cannot afford to wait for the transformation process to complete, a data scientist has to turn to raw data to gather insights.

What classes should I take if I want to become a data scientist?,"As a 10+ year Silicon Valley data science veteran who participates in hiring committee of a large Internet firm: Most questions in data science are causal inference questions. New hire data scientists generally are generally clueless about how to deal with these. 

Data scientists are often asked the following questions: 

%3E ""Does the company's new feature cause signups to increase?"" 
""Are people not signing up because of issues X, Y and Z?""
""Are our customers in [X] area being effected by [Issue Y]""? 


Questions like these are by far the most common. Each is a causal inference question at their core. Sadly, newhire ""data scientists"" are almost always  clueless about these subjects and often resort to this: 


%3E Well, my analysis shows these two variables are correlated. Of course correlation doesn't equal causation, but you can draw your own conclusion.

This is an unacceptable answer. Data scientists are hired so that non-quants don't have to draw their own conclusion. They should be able to solve the causal inference problem and separate correlation and causation. 

The above answer is ridiculously useless and unacceptable, and yet altogether common. Why does it happen? 

It happens because most aspiring data scientists buy into the ""size fetish"" that too many people in the data science community have. These people believe that the most important skill is to be able to perform basic descriptive statistics using Hadoop (or something similar) on at least 5K petabytes of data. 

In college and graduate school, these people learned to do this instead of learning causal inference. They believe that data science is about size. When they encounter causal inference problems later in their careers, they invite their client to ""draw their own conclusions."" 

Tragecomedy: Most of the questions above could be credibly answered using the standard causal inference techniques on a a relatively small, randomly selected sample (small enough to fit on a laptop). Nonetheless, nobody knows how to do this. It doesn't fit into the size fetish.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-data-science-skills-do-you-need-to-learn-and-need-to-know?top_ans=4126137,2014-02-11T23:11:05.311687+00:00,,73,Anonymous,
How can I make a good career in the data analytics industry? What are the skills I need to develop if I have to start from scratch?,"To make a good career in the data analytics industry, all you need is a will to work and read till the end. I can help you in the best way. The skills you need to develop to start from scratch are a command of programming language, knowledge of query language, visualisation, better communication, and good presentation skills. The first very useful step is choosing a domain-elective in which you want to work.

Let’s see the details to make a good career in the data analytics industry:

Getting experience in a domain: Recruiters prefer domain-experienced individuals as they can connect the performance of the business to data and bring instant value to the firm. It is important to consider how you will develop domain experience. If feasible, pick a career that would allow you to help several divisions within a corporation.

Because of the range of projects you'll participate in, and you'll obtain domain experience faster. Discuss initiatives involving other departments with your superior. Interact with colleagues in different groups to identify opportunities where data can be utilised to address an issue and propose this to your management as a project.

You need presentations skills: Find and watch sample data event presentations that have been put online. Examine how the speaker conveys their message to the audience and see if you can include it in your speeches.

If you do not have a chance to discuss data results, consider holding periodic meetings for group participants to share the analytics they conducted. This allows you to practice presentations and study how other experts convey their data. You may also use this chance to request suggestions for future talks.

Database knowledge is essential: Companies often favour applicants who have prior expertise with specific databases since it reduces their need to spend time training them.

Choose jobs that allow you to deal with a number of various methods that you have not yet worked with previously to broaden your expertise. If indeed the final choice is between you and another applicant who has no expertise with such systems, these good talents may tilt the scales in your favour. There are more essential factors to consider while selecting a job, but keep these in mind before final selection.

The skills you need to develop to have start data analysis from scratch:

 * You must have good programming abilities in Python, despite your work experience.
 * You must be willing to work with data in various forms, acquire data, cleanse it, and make logical sense of it.
 * You should also be familiar with a querying language such as SQL and be able to aggregate and evaluate data in massive databases swiftly.
 * As an analyst, you will benefit greatly from data visualisation, presentation, and communication abilities, and you will need to break down your results in an easy-to-understand manner.
 * If you are a naturally curious person who questions things, data analytics is a perfect career path for you. Each entry in the dataset you're working with represents a different part of a person's life.
The domain experience and skills you need are the primary and most important aspects of becoming a data analyst. Many institutes offer great college degrees but don't fall for that. It would help if you had expertise in a domain of interest. As such, there is an online learning institute that offers domain-oriented courses that very few institutes have. Learnbay, which provides certification from IBM.

Look at the domains provided by Learnbay. How that domain functions in data analytics:

 * Energy: Energy handles massive amounts of data gathered through practical techniques and procedures. The use of advanced analytics to this data aids in prediction and provides useful suggestions for energy.
 * Oil and Gas: It includes several procedures, including data retrieval and categorisation, to discover numerous patterns, interactions, interconnections, and other significant ideas.
 * Banking: Banks utilise data analytics to integrate vast, diversified consumer data to analyse and offer encouragement to customers for personalised, customised products and services that are tailored to their specific needs.
 * Finance: Fraud protection, risk evaluation, loan distribution, customer insights, and trading are just a few examples of how analysis can be used in finance.
 * Insurance: Analytical tools in insurance allow companies to filter through Internet things to understand better their customers' requirements, aspirations, and suggestions.
 * Human Resources: Human resource analytics, often called people data analysis, is concerned with studying societal problems and utilising data to answer crucial questions about your organisation.
 * Manufacturing: Manufacturing analytics uses operational, activity data, and technology in the manufacturing business to assure quality, boost performance and output and decrease costs.
 * Telecommunications: The purpose of data analysis in telecommunications is to provide each firm with a uniform picture of their information throughout departments. When data floods in from numerous data sets throughout the firm, the company could use most of its departments' recommendations to find the best solution for each difficulty.
 * Media: The capability to collect and make sense of data collected from social channels to support the business choices and monitor the performance of actions based on those decisions through social media is known as media analytics.
 * Hospitality: Inside the hotel sector, analytics is critical for business models, creating client loyalty, and increasing productivity. It helps hoteliers customise their visitor experiences, implement smarter hotel pricing methods, and grow their client base.
 * Sales and Marketing: Data analysis is the analysis of data collected from marketing initiatives to discover trends in things like how a strategy influenced sales, customer behaviour, geographical preferences and innovative preferences.
 * Transportation: Data analytics also aids in the improvement of transportation safety. Rental cars' information sensors give essential information regarding their efficiency.
 * Retail: Supply chain analysis may help a company better estimate market expectations by studying client data. It assists an organisation in determining which items may be reduced as they become less lucrative or determining what consumers want after the original order.
 * E-commerce: Consumer data analysis indicates how they engage with your site, their tastes, and which products they like. Since data analytics is so engaged behind the scenes, they can notify you when demand surges occur, allowing you to organise selling better.
 * Supply Chain: Supply chain analysis may help a company better estimate market expectations by studying client data. It assists an organisation in determining which items may be reduced as they become less lucrative or determining what consumers want after the original order.

What classes should I take if I want to become a data scientist?,"Today, we use the term ""data science"" to mean ""doing stuff with data."" Some data scientists build products, some optimize businesses, others try to understand businesses. Regardless of what a data scientist does, there are three things that a data scientist needs to understand to be effective:

(1) Math
(2) Computer Science
(3) The problem that he or she is solving

Let me explain a little more about each one.

(1) Math. Whether you have a lot of data or a little bit, you're going to have to use some math to make sense of it. Math helps you find patterns in data and determine if those patterns are meaningful. In practice, this means a data scientist needs to know some statistics and machine learning. It's helpful to know some algebra, signal processing, and topology as well. (Seriously.)

(2) Computer Science. Today, almost all the data that you encounter will be generated by and stored on computers. Often, you'll have to shrink that data, clean it up, or combine it with other data. Sometimes, you'll have so much data that you can't solve your problem quickly. In order to work with data, you'll have to know how to program a computer. But in order to cope with large amounts of data, you'll need to know about computer architecture and algorithms. You may even have to work with data that's stored in a cloud or processed on a distributed system. I'd recommend that any data scientist learn the basics of software engineering, algorithms, and computer architecture.

(3) The problem that he or she is solving. If you understand the problem you are trying to solve, and the data that you are trying to use, you will be able to distinguish answers that make sense from answers that do not, think of novel data sources to look for, and think of new ways to solve problems.  Don't underestimate the importance of understanding economics, physics, biology, or human psychology when you're tackling a problem. In practice, I'd recommend that a data scientist should have some training in economics (specifically econometrics and game theory), but any scientific training is helpful.

And finally, I wouldn't underestimate the value of experience. There's a lot of stuff that I've learned the hard way about cleaning data, running experiments, and implementing solutions. Academic training is a great start, but the real world is complicated and changes quickly. Any good training program needs to include some big, hands on projects with real world data (not clean toy data sets).",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-data-science-skills-do-you-need-to-learn-and-need-to-know?top_ans=1140890,2012-04-11T15:54:30.185550+00:00,,87,Joseph Adler,https://www.quora.com/profile/Joseph-Adler
How can I become a data scientist?,"I am working as a Data Scientist myself therefore it makes me qualified enough to answer your question.

What statistics should a data scientist know?,"I'm sorry I have to be that guy but...

Data ""science"" is just over glorified statistics (but with a new name and a few more algorithms from computer science). You have to know stats to do stats. Also, you're ambiguous about your data field. Are you into marketing? Do you handle data for physicists? Is it something related to econometrics? What are you expected to so with said data? These questions are not trivial - ""data"" is just as vague a term as ""information"", context is needed.

You could pick up Barry Cohen's book on applied stats or A. Field's guide for stats with R/SPSS. They are for social disciplines and are thus very easy to read. 

But if you have to work with more complex systems than Excel (say, you had to write code or make some AI program), you're going to need a lot more than just a cookbook knowledge of statistics. For example, a data ""scientist"" was bragging to me one time how he was making AI, how this field is the future. When I asked him things like ""Cool, what type of algorithm did you use? Why back-propagation over gradient descent? How did you prevent over-fitting? How many layers? Why?"", I received next to nothing of an answer. Don't be like that - do your work properly.

Get acquainted with the basics: hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, types of scales, distributions, etc. These can be found in nearly every stats textbook. Try also to understand Null Hypothesis Significance Testing and Bayesian Inference (don't be an idiot who simply ""goes Bayesian"", try to understand what they really mean, how they differ, why there is a difference among statisticians, why Fisher hated Bayesian inference). Also, try to work with R and/or Python. Other than that, it's up to you and your responsibilities with the data.

Good luck.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-data-science-skills-do-you-need-to-learn-and-need-to-know?top_ans=22183656,2016-04-30T17:06:57.503049+00:00,,420,Nikola Kasarov,https://www.quora.com/profile/Nikola-Kasarov

What new data science skills did you learn in the past week?,"Right now I am in the third week of prof Andrew Ng's machine learning course. In the past one week I learned following things

1. Classification using logistics regression. This involved hypothesis represention for logistics regression problem and understanding of decision boundary
2. Formulation of cost function and use of gradient descent to minimize the function in turn finding of the fitting parameters for hypothesis function.
3. Use of advanced optimization techniques like conjugate gradient, BFGS, L-BFGS. These algorithms are faster than gradient descent and do not involve selection of alpha (step size) parameter. In general, use readymade libraries of these algorithms and not try to implement them by yourself unless you are numerical computing expert.
4. Multiclass classification. What if we have more than two categories for classification?. Here strategy is to use binary classifications by choosing one class and lumping all other classes in to one class. Repeat this for every other class and then return the highest value.
5. What's underfitting and overfitting and how to avoid it. Underfitting happens when function maps poorly to the data. So we won't do so well on training data. Overfitting happens when we are doing well in training set and not so well on testing set. Overfitting can be avoided using reducing number of features, model selection algorithm and reducing magnitude of fitting parameters.
6. Implementation of logistics regression using Octave. This I have not completed but will do it tomorrow.

How do I become Data analyst/scientist? Do I need to have good programming skills?,"These were the 7 most common things I saw when I interviewed at big companies (Facebook, Intel, Square, eBay, etc) for data science related positions.

Basic Programming Languages: You should know a statistical programming language, like R or Python (along with Numpy and Pandas Libraries), and a database querying language like SQL

Statistics: You should be able to explain phrases like null hypothesis, P-value, maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals. Statistics is important to crunch data and to pick out the most important figures out of a huge dataset. This is critical in the decision-making process and to design experiments.

Machine Learning: You should be able to explain K-nearest neighbors, random forests, and ensemble methods. These techniques typically are implemented in R or Python.  These algorithms show to employers that you have exposure to how data science can be used in more practical manners.

Data Wrangling: You should be able to clean up data. This basically means understanding that ""California"" and ""CA"" are the same thing - a negative number cannot exist in a dataset that describes population. It is all about identifying corrupt (or impure) data and and correcting/deleting them.

Data Visualization: Data scientist is useless on his or her own. They need to communicate their findings to Product Managers in order to make sure those data are manifesting into real applications. Thus, familiarity with data visualization tools like ggplot is very important (so you can SHOW data, not just talk about them)

Software Engineering: You should know algorithms and data structures, as they are often necessary in creating efficient algorithms for machine learning. Know the use cases and run time of these data structures: Queues, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Trees, etc.

Product Management: This one is definitely debatable, but those who understand the product are the ones who will know what metrics are the most important. There are tons of numbers one can A/B test, so product-oriented data scientist will pick the right metrics to experiment with. Know what these terms mean: Usability Testing, Wireframing, Retention and Conversion Rates, Traffic Analysis, Customer Feedback, Internal Logs, A/B Testing.",https://www.quora.com/unanswered/What-data-science-skills-do-you-need-to-learn-and-need-to-know?top_ans=21974748,2016-04-24T22:21:37.264475+00:00,,252,Paul Jeon,https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Jeon-3

What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?,"In my opinion, these are some of the necessary skills:

UPDATE: I create a repo on github of hundreds of software links that should help get you started: https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning

1. Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5])

2. Probability and Statistics: A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.

3. Applied Math + Algorithms: For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16].

4. Distributed Computing: Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21].

5. Expertise in Unix Tools: Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1].

6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects: HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale.

7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques: feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though.

Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.

Good luck.

What are 3 main skills that I need to master during my first year of learning Data Science?,"1. Believe it or not, I think that the most important skill is data wrangling.
You can not imagine what sets of incomplete data, wrong data, duplicate data, we meet in regular work.

About 70% of the time is spent on the preparation of data, even when someone prepares data for us in advance.

In great advantage is that engineer who works well with this.

2. Statistics. I do not need to explain this. In order to correctly understand any DS problem, statistics must be known, since in essence every model, each solution, each output is reduced to probability at the end.

3. Python and individual DS methods.

This is in third place because when you have a well-prepared dataset and clearly understand the statistical background of the problems you are addressing, even if you do not know exactly which method to apply, you can easily find advice, help, and instruction on the Internet.

What are the key skills of a data scientist?,"Truth be told first - even if it disappoints many people -the industry does not have an agreed upon definition of a data scientist! 

Jokes like 'a data scientist is a data analyst living in the Silicon Valley' are abundant. Below is one such cartoon, just for fun.



Finding an 'effective' data scientist is hard and finding people who understand who a data scientist is equally hard. Note the use of 'effective' here, I use it to highlight that there could be people who might possess some of these skills yet may not be the best fit in a data science role. Irony is that even the people looking for hiring data scientists do not know who a data scientist is. Hiring managers post job descriptions for traditional data analyst and business analyst roles while the title calling it a 'Data Scientist' role.  

Everything that I say below is my experience working in a data scientist role with a major search engine and advertising platform. Instead of giving a bullet list of skills, I would first highlight the difference between some data related roles. 

Consider the following scenario. Shop-Mart and Bulk-Mart are two competitors in selling retail. Some higher up in the management chain asks this question: ""How many Shop-Mart customers also go to Bulk-Mart?"". 

[Please note that the question might be of interest to Bulk-Mart management or even a third party, possibly a market research or consumer behavior company, interested in shopping behavior of the population.]



Here is how different data-related roles will approach the problem. This 

Traditional BI/Reporting Professional: Generate reports from structured data using SQL and some kind of reporting services (SSRS for instance) and send the data back to management. The management asks more questions based on the data that was sent and cycle continues. Insights about data are most likely not included in the reports. A person in this role will be experienced mostly in database related skills.

Data Analyst: In addition to doing what the BI guy did, a data analyst will also keep other factors like seasonality, segmentation and visualization in mind. What about if certain trends in shopping behavior are tied to seasonality? What if the trends are different across gender, demographics, geography, product category? A data analyst will slice and dice the data to understand and annotate the report with it. Besides database skills, a data analyst will have a understanding of some of the common visualization tools.

Business Analyst: A business analyst possess the skills that the BI and data analysts have plus domain knowledge and understanding of the business. A business analyst may also have some basic skills in forecasting etc.

Data Mining or Big Data Engineer: Do what the data analyst did, possibly from unstructured data if needed. MapReduce and other big data skills may be needed. Understands the common issues in running jobs on large scale data and is able to debug the jobs. 

Statistician (A traditional one): Pull the data from a DB or obtain it from any of the roles mentioned above and run appropriate statistical tests. Ensure the quality of data and correctness of the conclusions by using standard practices like choosing the right sample size, confidence level, level of significance, type of test etc. 
The situation has changed a bit recently. Statistics departments at most schools have evolved in way that statisticians graduate with strong programming and decent foundation skills in CS enabling them to do the tasks that statisticians traditionally were not trained in.

Program/Project Manager: Look at the data provided by the professionals mentioned so far, align business with the findings and influence the leadership to take appropriate action. Possesses communication skills, presentation skills and can influence without authority.
Ironically the person a PM is influencing business decisions using the data and insights provided by others. If the person does not have a knack for understanding data, chances are that the person will not be able to influence others to take the correct decisions. 


Now putting it altogether.

The rise of online services has brought a paradigm shift in software development life cycle and how business iterate over successive features and products. Having a different data puller, analyst, statistician and project manager is just now possible any more. The mantra now is ship, experiment and learn, adapt, ship, experiment and learn .... This situation has resulted in the birth of a new role - ' A Data Scientist'

A data scientist should have the skills of all the individuals I have mentioned so far. In addition to the skills mentioned above, a data scientist should have rapid prototyping and programming, machine learning, visualization and hacking skills. 

Domain Knowledge and Soft Skills Are As Important as Technical Skills:
The importance of domain knowledge and soft skills like communication and influencing without authority are severely under-estimated both by hiring managers and aspiring data scientists. Insights without domain knowledge can potentially mislead the consumers of these insights. Correct insights without the ability to influence the decision making is as bad as having no insights.

All of what I have said above is based on my own tenure as a data scientist at a major search engine and later the advertising platform within the same company. I learnt that sometimes people asking the question may not know what they want to know - sounds preposterous - yet happens way too often. Very often a bozo will start rat holing into something that is not related to the issue at hand - just to prove that he/she is relevant. A data scientist encounters such HIPPOS (Highly Paid Person's Opinion) that are somewhat unrelated to the problem if not complete nonsense very often. A data scientist should posses the right soft skills to manage situations where people ask irrelevant, distracting or outside of scope questions. This is hard, especially in situations where the person asking the question is several levels up in the corporate ladder and is known to have an ego. It is a data scientist's responsibility to manage up and around while presenting and communicating insights. 

Below is a summary of necessary skills a data scientist should possess in my opinion.

Curiosity About Data and Passion for Domain: If you are not passionate about the domain/business and curious about  data then it is unlikely that you will succeed in a data scientist role. If you are working as a data scientist with an online retailer, you should be hungry all the time to crunch and munch from the Smörgåsbord (of data of course) to know more. If your curiosity does not keep you awake, no skill in the world can help you succeed. 

Soft Skills: Communication and influencing without authority. Understanding of what is the minimum that has the maximum impact. Too many findings are as bad as no findings at all.   Ability to scoop information out of partners and customers, even from the unwilling ones is extremely important. The data you are looking for may not be sitting in one single place. You may have to beg, borrow, steal and do whatever it takes to get the data.

Being a good story teller is also something that helps. Sometimes the insights obtained from data are counter-intuitive, if you are not a good story teller, it will be difficult to convince your audience.

Math/Theory: Machine Learning. Stats and Probability 101. Optimization would be icing on the cake.

CS/Programming: At least one scripting language (I prefer python). Decent algorithms and DS skills, to be able to write code that can analyze a lot of data efficiently. You may not be a production code developer but should be able write code that does not suck. Database management and SQL skills. Knowledge of a statistical computing package, most people including myself prefer R. A spread sheet software like excel.

Big Data and Distributed Systems: Understanding of basic MapReduce concepts, Hadoop and Hadoop file system and least one language like Hive/Pig. Some companies have their own proprietary implementations of these languages. Knowledge of tools like Mahout and any of the xaaS like Azure and AWS would be helpful. Once again big companies have their own xaaS so you may be working on variants of any of these.

Visualization: Ability to create simple yet elegant and meaningful visualization. In my case, R packages like ggplot, lattice and others have helped me in most cases but there are other packages that you can use. In some cases, you might want to use D3. 


Below is a visualization of high level description of skills needed to become a data scientist.


Where is a data scientist in the big data pipeline?
Here is a nice visualization of the big data pipeline, the associated technologies and the regions of operation. In general the depiction of where the data scientist belongs in this pipeline is largely correct, there is one caveat however. A data scientist should be comfortable to dive into the 'Collect' and 'Store' territories if needed. Usually  data scientists would be working on transformed data and beyond but in scenarios where the business does cannot afford to wait for the transformation process to complete, a data scientist has to turn to raw data to gather insights.

2. Statistics: A strong foundation in statistics is important for data scientists, as they often need to analyze data and draw insights from it.
3. Data visualization: Data scientists should be able to effectively visualize data and communicate their findings through graphs and charts.
4. Data wrangling: Data scientists often need to work with messy or unstructured data, so skills in data cleaning and preparation are important.
5. Machine learning: Many data science roles involve building and applying machine learning models, so a good understanding of machine learning algorithms is important.
6. Domain expertise: Data scientists often work with data related to a particular industry or domain, so having expertise in that area can be beneficial.
In addition to these technical skills, data scientists should also have strong communication and collaboration skills, as they often work with cross-functional teams and need to present their findings to a variety of audiences.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-useful-skills-to-have-for-a-career-in-data-science?top_ans=1477743628167015,2023-01-07T17:53:21.973682+00:00,,0,Prithivi Raj,https://www.quora.com/profile/Prithivi-Raj-386
Is Data Science actually in demand? What skills can make me launch a fruitful career in Data Science?,"Data Science is in demand. But….

 * OSS and Cloud (AWS/GCP) tools are quickly commoditizing the mechanical parts of Data Science. Being able to re-format text files and run a few ML algorithms used to take specialized programming skills. Now, non-technical users can plug files into data warehouse tools and get answers without programming expertise. If all you know is the simple stuff, you’re in trouble.
 * Machine learning libraries are good. ML specialists used to have to know and be able to implement dozens of algorithms to get results. Now, almost anyone who can spit out working Python can use numpy to build basic (or advanced) ML models. 

There’s still a place for advanced ML experts — but it’s at Google, building DeepMind, and they are the best of the best.
 * There are a lot of Data Scientists coming out of bootcamps. A lot of them are able to execute quickly and cheaply on simple problems. Most of them will find jobs, but they’re going to have to fight to turn them into careers.
The distinguishing feature is increasingly the ability of a Data Scientist to turn the insights they generate from data into actionable results. This looks different at every company.

 * You’ve built a promising machine-learning model from some data; can you work with a product manager to package this into a product your company can sell?
 * You’ve built a workflow to sanitize and shrink your input data by 50%: can you turn this into a reliable application to save the company money?
If you can take ownership of the whole data application life-cycle (generate idea, iterate, productionize it), you will 10x your value to the company, and set yourself apart.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-useful-skills-to-have-for-a-career-in-data-science?top_ans=159754362,2019-08-09T08:08:28.475545+00:00,,328,Ben Podgursky,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ben-Podgursky
How can I become a data scientist?,"I am working as a Data Scientist myself therefore it makes me qualified enough to answer your question.

Also I will make sure to include the tricks in my answer that worked for me.

So Let's begin, Shall we?

I will be answering this question, keeping in mind that a bunch of readers could be complete newbies into programming.

So addressing non-computer science students. Firstly, you need to work a lot on your problem-solving skills which is going to help you code effortlessly. You can achieve this by learning Data structures & Algorithms and coding in it. Also, DS & Algo are the building block of computer science so it will definitely help you on your Journey towards excellence in coding.

After you are comfortable with problem-solving, you should stick to the below mentioned points:

1. Opt for a good course on Machine learning and study it thoroughly to become well versed with all it’s concepts.
2. Practice machine learning problems on Kaggle: Your Machine Learning and Data Science Community [ https://www.kaggle.com/ ] which will help you gain confidence and give you enough hands-on skills.
3. Post your projects on GitHub, LinkedIn and also you can use youtube to showcase your skills
4. Now it’s Time to market yourself. Make a clean and creative online portfolio and a strong resume based on ML. Start applying to your desired companies and surely circumstances will bend in your favour and soon you will become something you have worked so hard for and that is “Data scientist”
5. you can connect with me on LinkedIn
Ps: I am attaching my photo, in which you can see me working from home, just in case you are interested to know how a data scientist looks?! 😛

What kind of additional skills or qualifications are needed to succeed in data science?,"Here are 2 answers:

The short version is to study mathematics/statistics/quantitative STEM, and learn SQL.

I cannot recommend any other linear paths “to succeed in data science”. Data science is not linear. Mathematics will give you the most valuable toolkit you can develop for studying problems in this field, and will teach you to think non-linearly.

If data systems are like a locked vault, SQL is the key. Mathematics will show you how to use the contents of the vault, but SQL opens the door.

I would also pick up at least one of python or R, and read some philosophy, especially Experimental Philosophy:

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/experimental-philosophy/
__________________________________________________________________________________

Long version: do not aim for data science as a role or title. It is an overloaded term with a lot of fresh graduates chasing it, which is simultaneously fracturing into various specialties like data engineering (DE), machine learning engineering (MLE), analytics engineering, various analyst roles, and other roles. Also, other roles like product manager or marketing specialist are increasingly expected to know basic data science skills. If you have a passion for another role and bring relevant data science skills to the table, you are likely to shine in your field, without competing for an overloaded role or title. In other words, you can “succeed in data science” by seeking other roles that are calling for people with data science skills.

Mike West [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-West-99 ] has been correctly predicting the fracturing of the data scientist role in his posts on Quora for several years now. Read some of his posts. They reflect the experience of someone who has lots of engineering experience working with data systems, and disgruntled experience working with people who interact with those systems. I disagree with him on quite a number of things - including the relevance of languages like R and Python - but he still makes many good points which help illustrate why data engineering has been taking jobs away from data science. Besides, you need to be able to navigate differing opinions on complex topics - without throwing your hands up in the air in defeat - “to succeed in data science”. You are likely to encounter engineers like Mike who think that data science is BS.

I usually dislike Gartner’s over-simplified analyses, but this provides reasonable context for what is happening in the field. Sometimes simple is good for illustrating a concept. Data science as a job title has slid down the Peak of Inflated Expectations into the Trough of Disillusionment. Then it fractured into multiple job titles, some of which have been around for a long time (e.g. analyst) and some of which are newer (e.g. data engineer). But the underlying utility of data science is more like a linear (y=x) function in my mind. Hype =/= utility.

I would also step back and ask what success looks like to you. Get philosophical. It is like defining a target for an analysis or predictive model: you need to be specific. What is your specific goal, and why? Is it to indulge curiosity? To enter a field in high demand? To obtain a high salary? Be honest with yourself. The reason can be multi-faceted, but if there is not an element of curiosity in your answer, I would suggest staying away because this career will not be fun for you. You will be another person contributing to burnout statistics and failed data science projects. That may even happen if you are curious, but then at least you will find the motivation to learn, adapt, and grow so you come out of that stronger.

Also, it is important to understand bias and framing effects as matters of practical philosophy (thanks Ross: Ross.Lederhman [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Ross-Lederhman-1 ] for introducing me to the concept of a “framing effect”). Note that the Stanford article I linked on Experimental Philosophy in the short version of this answer has 3 separate references mentioning “framing effects”. Here is a decent article on framing effects:

https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/framing-effect
Though I partially disagree with this assertion:


%3E “Research has shown that people who are more “involved” on an issue are less likely to suffer from framing effects surrounding it.”
Affinity bias, authority bias, and the cheerleader effect can lead “involved” people to erroneous or myopically framed conclusions. When you have a hammer, everything begins to look like a nail. Especially when other people like you have the same hammer, the experts have the same hammer, and everyone you personally know in your field is cheering about how useful these hammers are. We all have biases, and most people are not very aware of their own biases, their organizations’ biases, and biases in the data collection, storage, transformation, and selection processes. This is where a lot of projects fail.

Now that I have that out of the way, data science is incredibly useful. Personally, I think it is a fascinating field and I cannot get enough. The world produces ever more data, and makes ever more decisions off that data. But, a fair bit of that data is junk. Many of the analyses run off that data are junk. Many of the analyses run off of good data are also junk. Why? We will get to that, but read the short answer again if those statements confuse you. Still confused? Keep reading.

Organizations do not have enough people developing good systems for collecting, organizing, validating, and transforming data. There are also too many people chasing the title Data Scientist, and a couple years ago there were too many companies chasing people who wanted the title. So naturally, with the high salaries and influx of people of all kinds of skill levels with all kinds of backgrounds, there was disillusionment with the costs of producing analyses and data products. One trend most organizations are hopping on to fix this is to improve their data engineering practices. Which is why data engineering has not suffered the slowdown that data science has.

Having a passion for studying problems is probably the most important thing a data scientist brings to the table. You need to measure and derive insights from those measures. You need to be able to do useful things with data. If you do not have a passion for studying and analyzing problems, stay away because this career is not for you. Data is just the medium, not the objective. Now, what counts as “doing useful things with data”?

For a small grant-funded non-profit, doing useful things with data may be something as simple as automating the download of reports from a Client Management System (CMS), putting useful metrics up on a dashboard, and sharing that dashboard with members of the organization. Now the frontline people get to actually see how the data they input gets reflected in a dashboard, and your conversations with them about improving data entry practices actually have some meaning. They can see it. The consequences of following good data entry practices now become more tangible and real to them, not just something they comply with without understanding why. Now maybe their data will suck less. Then they can do predictive analytics to optimize staffing when there is high forecasted demand for a particular program. Maybe a non-profit that handles immigration settlement reacts more quickly to a spike in immigration from a particular country due to an emerging crisis, and thus they can reach out to their grant funder (often government) for more funds to hire staff to expand that program.

For a large tech company, doing useful things with data may look like taking gigabytes, terabytes, or even petabytes of user data from their platform(s) and constructing useful deep learning models (like transformer based large language models (LLMs)) that can predict user preferences and make prescriptive recommendations on content they are most likely to engage with. This may be to drive ads and ad revenue, give recommendations for other users a user might want to follow on an app platform, or to improve the UX of a product to minimize frustrations and maximize engagement.

Sounds very different between those two theoretical organizations - the small grant-funded non-profit and the large tech company - right? Well, it is. There is also a massive amount of variety in-between these organizations, and that is where most of the jobs are right now. The small organizations cannot afford to hire you, and the large ones just laid off some of their engineers, data scientists, and especially their product management and recruitment staff.

Have I scared you off? No? Good, that means you find this subject interesting enough to keep reading. The overview of data science I am linking below is a few years old, but it lists additional key skills and concepts for the field that remain relevant today. Note that some specific technologies may change, but many of the other core skills do not. e.g. Hadoop has been on the way out for awhile due to tools like Spark, and Spark is less widely needed than before because tools like Databricks remove the need to know Spark while simultaneously benefitting from using it on the back-end.

What are the best skills for aspiring data scientists to have at the beginning of their careers?,"Let’s use the term machine learning engineer.

That’s the title most are really preparing for. The data scientist is the math and models type and this often requires advanced degrees.

Right now there are three big careers in this space. Big meaning, well respected and well compensated.

1. Data scientist
2. Data engineer
3. Machine learning engineer
Machine learning engineers are developers that spend most of their time wrangling data and building models.

My job title really should be Chief Data Janitor.

Ok, let’s answer your question.

The best skills are:

1. SQL - Most real world models are sourced from relational databases. If don’t know SQL then you are shit out of luck.
2. Python - Just about everything else. It’s the gold standard in applied machine learning.
3. Libraries - Core Python isn’t enough. You’ll need to be skilled working with Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, matplotlib… a few more.

"What are the most marketable skills in the field of Data, Analysis, and Data Science?","In my decade of experience in data clean-up, data analysis, core modeling, data sciences (mostly machine learning or M/L), mobile analytics etc. I think 2 fundamental skills are to ""think logically"" and ""instrumenting right data"".  Most problems get solved when you know what and how to instrument and interpret the results logically.  Everything else can be learnt assuming you have a sharp curve and decent appetite.

Briefly the necessary steps could be - Think how you frame the business problem, how you get the data, what needs to be done to that data, how to determine what to do, doing the algo/technique, interpreting algorithm results, implement the model/results to the problem, visualization, feedback, optimize- every step has a combination of tools/techniques.. 

In terms of giving names of tools, techniques etc here is the list:

1. Tools like  Hadoop, PIG, SAS, R, Python, Weka, Knime etc  are useful
2. Techniques that involve  decent statistical knowledge starting from parametric/non parametric tests to regressions to classifications
3. Fundamental mathetical knowledge 
4. For M/L, understanding  SVM, neural networks or any other technique to a decent depth so that you know how its being used to get results
5. Image processing (face recognition etc) , Information retrieval and  AI techniques

Iam assuming basic stuff like excel, SQL (basic) is already known.

Also please note that data scientists require different skill sets than business analysts who require another set of skills from optimization skill sets.
It's almost not possible to understand everything in depth but may be if you spend enough time in analytics and data sciences you will be able to know what you still do not know and what you do not understand.

What are the skills that everybody should know?,"1. Basic computer skills. In today’s world, knowing basic computer skills is synonymous to being literate.
2. Basic first aid. Comes in handy and very useful in times of need.
3. Cooking. No dependency on anyone. Be self reliant and satisfy yourself with home cooked food whenever you want.
4. Driving. Even if you don’t need to drive daily, it is a good idea that one learns this.
5. Dressing aptly. No matter what job you are in, dressing does create an impression on others. There are only few for whom their other qualities over shadow their dressing sense but for most it doesn’t.
6. Karate/ Taekwondo. Being learned enough of at least one defence mechanism is only going to do good.
7. Delegation : Cut loose yourself from unimportant stuff, focus on important, and delegate the rest. That’s how you grow.
8. Self learning : There is no stopping for one who masters this.
9. Communication skills : Be it verbal or written, it goes a long way in speeding your growth if you are able to convey your thoughts clearly.
10. Money management : Well, keeping a track of your income and expenditure improve your money habits and hence helps you avoid unnecessary loans and expenditure and consequently brings peace of mind.
11. Time management : 24 hours are more than enough to do things you want to and need to do if you manage time effectively. Planning, prioritizing and doing stuff that ways is the key to enhance productivity and hence growth.
12. Critical analysis : Being able to evaluate and analyze various options, events, scenarios and statements makes you think out of the box, take decisions based on your ideas and bring clarity to your thoughts.

Why do you think data science is going to be so important?,"Because data science helped elect Donald Trump!

If there’s one person who deserves much more respect than he gets and (I think) is much smarter than people think, it’s Jared Kushner (Trump’s son-in-law), who oversaw the data operation for the Trump campaign.

According to this [ https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2016/11/22/exclusive-interview-how-jared-kushner-won-trump-the-white-house/#71e3add43af6 ] Forbes article, he built a 100-person data hub in Texas, which dictated every campaign decision including travel, fundraising, advertising, rally locations and even the topics of the speeches. He seems to have understood the true power of data-driven decision making and machine learning for sentiment manipulation and message tailoring.

As a simple example, the data operation extensively used social media micro-targeting to move from selling $8000 worth of merchandise per day to $80,000 per day, thus massively increasing the number of human billboards (aka “Make America Great Again” hats) in key swing states.

Yes, Obama did something similar in 2007. But a lot has changed in 9 years, especially the relevance of social media. From the same article:


%3E ""Jared Kushner is the biggest surprise of the 2016 election,"" adds Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, who helped design the Clinton campaign's technology system. ""Best I can tell, he actually ran the campaign and did it with essentially no resources.""
And that is why data science is important. The amount of data the world generates is increasing exponentially and with that, the number of “unconventional” fields (politics, sports, journalism, etc.) that can now benefit from data is also ever increasing.

What statistics should a data scientist know?,"I'm sorry I have to be that guy but...

Data ""science"" is just over glorified statistics (but with a new name and a few more algorithms from computer science). You have to know stats to do stats. Also, you're ambiguous about your data field. Are you into marketing? Do you handle data for physicists? Is it something related to econometrics? What are you expected to so with said data? These questions are not trivial - ""data"" is just as vague a term as ""information"", context is needed.

You could pick up Barry Cohen's book on applied stats or A. Field's guide for stats with R/SPSS. They are for social disciplines and are thus very easy to read. 

But if you have to work with more complex systems than Excel (say, you had to write code or make some AI program), you're going to need a lot more than just a cookbook knowledge of statistics. For example, a data ""scientist"" was bragging to me one time how he was making AI, how this field is the future. When I asked him things like ""Cool, what type of algorithm did you use? Why back-propagation over gradient descent? How did you prevent over-fitting? How many layers? Why?"", I received next to nothing of an answer. Don't be like that - do your work properly.

Get acquainted with the basics: hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, types of scales, distributions, etc. These can be found in nearly every stats textbook. Try also to understand Null Hypothesis Significance Testing and Bayesian Inference (don't be an idiot who simply ""goes Bayesian"", try to understand what they really mean, how they differ, why there is a difference among statisticians, why Fisher hated Bayesian inference). Also, try to work with R and/or Python. Other than that, it's up to you and your responsibilities with the data.

There are years upon years of content and theoretically, you can learn data science forever. Here’s what it takes to become a self-taught data scientist:

Mindsets You Must Internalize:

 * Always Be Learning: The reality of this field, is that there are always new packages, libraries, algorithms created. This means, you must always be willing to learn new tools, new methodologies. Many things you do today, may be outdated in a few years.
 * Figuring things out on your own: Many times, you will encounter bugs or problems where you have nobody there to answer your questions. You must get good at figuring out things on your own. This means, reading stack overflow, blog posts, videos to teach yourself new concepts.
 * Handle Frustration: You must be able to withstand frustration when you are doing a lot of work and there is seemingly no progress. You must be comfortable with running lots of failed experiments. You must be comfortable spending hours debugging code.
Once you understand those mindsets, here's the progression I'd recommend:

1. Pick an interesting data problem that you're excited about: The purpose of data science is to solve problems. Learning data science is a difficult, difficult process . The way to maintain enough motivation to push through these obstacles, is to be working on a problem you’re genuinely interested in. Perhaps, it's composing music using deep learning, predicting the price of bitcoin, visualizing basketball shot charts etc. Start with an interesting problem and find interesting projects that people have done.

2. Find someone’s github who has built a project you’re excited about: Finding someone else’s open-sourced code will give you direct feedback on where you are in terms of skill level. By finding another project, this also gives you a solid “goal” to aim for with your project. Don’t worry about understanding the code, we just need a goal.

3. Break down the project into bite-sized chunks and then find resources that fill these chunks of knowledge: I like using the CRISP-DM methodology [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining ] in building data science project. The principle here, is that we learn just enough to be able to move forward in the CRISP-DM methodology. Pick one resource and use the rest as supplemental resources. Don’t drown in information. Pick the resources that resonate best with your learning style.

a. Programming: You'll need to build your project in some language, so you'll need programming. Either R or Python will do:

- Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way

- Google's Python Course: Google's Python Class | Python Education
 | Google Developers [ https://developers.google.com/edu/python/ ]

b. Data Acquisition: To get your data you could find them using the ready-made sites or scrape your data:

- Kaggle [ http://kaggle.com ]

- data.world [ http://data.world ]

- 100+ Interesting Data Sets for Statistics - rs.io [ http://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/ ]

or....

- Building your own web scraper: https://www.dataquest.io/course/apis-and- scraping

c. SQL: Building your own projects won’t require you to necessarily need SQL. However, SQL is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT if you want to work as a data scientist at any company. I guarantee you will also be tested on this in interviews. Good resources:

 * hackerrank [ https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql ]
 * Mode Analytics’ SQL Course [ https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/ ]
d. Data Cleaning/Transformation: So you know how to code and you have data. How do you actually start manipulating the dataset? If you chose Python, you'll need to learn Pandas or Numpy. If you're using R, these libraries are built-into the language:

- Numpy & Pandas: 10 Minutes to pandas [ http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html ]

e. Data Visualization: Viz + cleaning/transformation iteratively go together. This means, that you transform to get a certain visualization and then transform again to get another visualization. Great viz resources:

- R: Hadley Wickham's R for Data Science: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data- visualisation.html#the-layered-grammar-of-graphics

- Matplotlib: Data Visualization With Matplotlib Course [ https://www.dataquest.io/course/exploratory-data-visualization ]

f. Statistics: Once you create histograms, boxplots etc, it'll be important to be able ot understand these diagrams. To do this, you'll need statistics. Khan Academy [ http://khanacademy.org ] is great for these concepts.

g. Linear Regression/Logistic Regression:

- Read the Linear & Logistic Regression sections of ISLR: http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf

h. Machine Learning: Use arxiv [ https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent ] to find research papers on a variety of algorithms. Because you found someone who’s built your project, you already know which algorithms they used.

Grab a pen & notepad and really dig into the research papers. It’s likely that you won’t understand anything the first time you read a research paper. Don’t give up. I probably re-read a paper 10+ times to make sure I understand how the algorithm works.

4. Make your project public on github, a blog and write a good README: You want this project to be part of your portfolio, essentially proof that you can build data science projects. Write a good README explaining your thought process on why you chose certain algorithms. Articulating this also prepares you well for interviews, as companies will ask you about this.

5. Repeat: Do this multiple times so you build out your portfolio.

6. Networking/Job-Hunting: Do this concurrently with Step 5. This means, going out to meetup events, using LinkedIn to connect, asking for intros. This step is just as important for becoming a data scientist, however, this would require another post.

Data Science interviews are actually a separate beast to tackle, with whiteboarding, coding challenges, take-homes. This also, will require another post.

All in all, I’d say, becoming a self-taught data scientist, will require at least 500–700 hours of learning upfront. Whether you want to do this in 3 months, a year, two years, depends on your situation. After you finish these 500 hours, you should know just enough to get an entry-level data scientist position. Once you’ve got a solid portfolio setup & your skillset honed, you should split your time 50/50 studying for interviews + job applications.

How hard is the work of a data scientist?,"It’s an office job. It’s not hard work.

I’ve been watching the HBO series Chernobyl recently, about the 1986 nuclear accident. A team of coal miners were brought in to seal off the nuclear core by digging a tunnel under the power plant. They worked around the clock in deadly levels of radiation and extreme temperatures. They couldn’t set up fans, because that would swirl up radioactive dust.

Now, that’s hard work.

I, on the other hand, sit in a comfortable chair in my office with two large, friendly monitors, sipping a cup of coffee. Sometimes, I eat lunch, play foosball or have an informal chat with colleagues.

As a data scientist, I don’t have hard deadlines to deal with. I’m an experimenter, an explorer. I massage the data and ask it questions. I don’t have to work long evenings to get a new release finished. I release code whenever I have something new. I don’t get called in the middle of the night because some system is down. I monitor the performance of my models and update them if they degrade.

I have to keep up to date with technical knowledge, but learning about new technologies and techniques is what got me into this line of work in the first place. I do it because it’s fun, not because I have to.

Generally speaking, the eight hours I spend at work is the easiest part of my day.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-skills-needed-for-a-data-scientist-job?top_ans=143566632,2019-05-26T10:44:27.425407+00:00,2019-05-28T13:39:01.898175+00:00,3533,Håkon Hapnes Strand,https://www.quora.com/profile/Håkon-Hapnes-Strand

What are the best companies for a data scientist to work for?,"When seeking out the optimal data science company to join, a number of factors must be taken into account. Preferences may lean towards smaller data science firms, industry-specific data projects, or geographical constraints. I personally prefer customer-centric companies with a lot of scope to explore my own data science interests, but everyone is different.


%3E I will guide you through what I consider to be the most desirable companies for data scientists. My evaluation encompasses a blend of compensation, work/life balance, and significance in the industry - how cool the work is. Lastly, I've categorized them by size.
Let's delve into the finest options for data science employment.

PRIME DATA SCIENCE EMPLOYERS: LARGE CORPORATIONS

1. Microsoft

Microsoft has a lot of cool data-science focused projects and products. Although they are known as an enterprise and consumer software company, Microsoft is a tech giant and is still a formidable data science company.

Just as an example, they have one project called AI for Earth, which puts their Cloud and AI tools in the hands of people working to improve the environment.

They develop open source tools, data, APIs, and models to support technology development for sustainability efforts.

They also have the AI for Accessibility program that aims to shrink the “data desert” and fill the gaps of AI data sets for those with disabilities.

On top of their admirable research and open source projects, Microsoft has a wide range of products for consumers, enterprises, and developers. You can work on products from Microsoft Word to Xbox. With such a wide variety of end users and products, you can likely find an area that fits your interests, or try out several different product areas by moving around internally.

2. Amazon

Amazon has transcended its origins as a mere online bookseller and evolved into a premier destination for data science employment.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) dominates the cloud services sector in terms of individual market share. Within the realm of data science enterprises, Amazon stands as a juggernaut, using data scientists to provide machine learning and data science solutions alongside its AWS cloud services.

On top of their AWS-centered data science services, Amazon offers anti-fraud products for their online retail customers that use machine learning to detect fraud among their plethora of transactions.

3. Airbnb

Airbnb worked really hard to change how people travel. They've found a great way to use data scientists. The person who used to lead their data team said that they see data as what customers are saying, and data science helps understand that.

I think it's awesome to work for companies that focus on customers. The choices they make have good reasons, and they're meant to help both customers and the company.

Airbnb used data science to make their services and search better. They also used it to make their hiring process fairer. They used data science to check and fix any unfairness in how they hire people.

Data science companies can use what they know to make their own operations better. Airbnb shows this well. They're always looking at themselves and finding ways to do things better. That's why I believe Airbnb is one of the best companies for data scientists to work at.

4. NVidia

There exist data science companies, and then there's Nvidia. Nvidia has pioneered ""accelerated analytics,"" enabling data processing up to 20 times faster without necessitating reconfiguration, courtesy of GPUs like the NVIDIA DGX A100s.

In the business landscape, time equates to money, and Nvidia's optimizations have yielded significant success for their graphics cards. Their data scientists engage with state-of-the-art chips and graphics cards to optimize performance when struggling with extensive amounts of data.

Nvidia provides a unique opportunity to enhance data scientists' global endeavors. The potential for exponential impact on the efficiency of data science work renders Nvidia a perfect destination for data science professionals, promising substantial influence and satisfaction.

5. Oracle

Oracle's cloud platform is a testament to their ingenuity, empowering customers to harness their data via machine learning models, visualizations, and predictive analytics.

What companies employ the world’s best data scientists?,"The predictable answer is that many of the world’s best data scientists work at some of the largest, most successful and most well-known tech companies in the world. Places like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent. The usual suspects.

These companies employ armadas of data scientists and offer good benefits, interesting challenges and prestige. They’re a safe option and a natural first place to look for a job.

It may almost seem like Big Tech is where all the best data scientists work, but that’s simply not the case.

I know some truly amazing data scientists who work at startups you’ve never heard of. Semi-early stage startups may offer competitive compensation packages for experienced data scientists along with more responsibility and technical challenges that some might find more interesting. There’s also the allure of being a key employee in a company that could potentially become a unicorn.

Some successful data scientists go all out and start their own companies as well.

Then you have data scientists who work as consultants and contractors, being either self-employed or employed at consulting firms. This type of gig may offer more money at the cost of higher risk. The work is more diverse, requiring a more generalized skillset as well as strong interpersonal skills. It’s not for everyone, but for some it’s great.

Finally, there are data scientists who work at regular non-tech companies. It may be an investment bank, a petroleum company, a retail chain or any other type of company you can think of. Although it may not be the first place you’d expect to find a world-class data scientist, that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Sometimes, if a company really wants a superstar to kickstart their data science initiatives, they can go to great lengths to attract the right talent.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-companies-for-a-data-scientist-to-work-for?top_ans=182375098,2019-11-24T11:52:02.341711+00:00,2019-11-24T11:52:43.412609+00:00,90,Håkon Hapnes Strand,https://www.quora.com/profile/Håkon-Hapnes-Strand
How do I choose which company to join as a data scientist?,"I had the same question a year ago. Now I am working at Wayfair, with several of my friends working in companies of all ranks, I can share with you some of my insights.

Foremost of all, pick a place with big data. I can’t stress enough the importance of being able to develop a model that scales well. Many methods (SVM for example) do not scale well in the big data realm, and many that do need special engineering attention to achieve efficiency. Not to mention the trade-off between number of observation and the number of features. All of these you won’t be possibly able to experience with you have less than 1G of data.

Second, pick a place with medium size data science team. I assume you are just starting your career as a Data Scientist, it is vital you have people who can help solve your problems. A team that is too small means simple infrastructure and little time to learn the best industry practice. A team that is too large means everything is well established, and every role specialized. You don’t have exposure to different aspect of data science. In a team with medium size, you get enough coaching from senior folks and also get a chance to explore different things. At Wayfair, I learn many tricks from my colleagues, and also because the role of data scientist are not fully specialized, we do many things like feature engineering, modeling, productionizing, etc. If you are an aspiring data scientist, and are willing to invest your spare time, you will become what I like to call ‘full-stack data scientist’. Your experience with multiple aspect of data science will be invaluable to your career.

Finally, pick a company that has a data science team with people from diverse background. People from different backgrounds brings different expertise that you can learn from. An engineer will show you best coding practice, and the difference between prototyping and production. A statistician will help you find out the best model for your particular need, and an person with industry experience will just point you to the right feature. It promotes collaboration.

That is the 5 cents I have for you. Hope you find it helpful.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-companies-for-a-data-scientist-to-work-for?top_ans=95543114,2018-08-15T21:45:17.684555+00:00,,6,Danyang Su,https://www.quora.com/profile/Danyang-Su-1

Which companies are considered dream companies for data scientists and data engineers to work for?,"I’d say, in general, they’ll be the same “dream” companies that any other software engineers want to work for. Google, Netflix, Facebook, etc.

My dream company for data engineering/science would have to be Spotify, though! I don’t know much about the engineering culture because I haven’t worked there.

However, I have always had this thought that it would be SO cool to build a GOOD recommendation system for playlists. I think Spotify actually does this pretty well already!

But how sweet would it be to build a music streaming service with top-notch playlist recommendations? Think something like: being able to listen to a few of your favorite songs and then have the service build you an entire playlist curated just for your tastes! Sounds like a prime use-case for some machine learning goodness.

Obviously easier said than done. I’m always on the hunt for that perfect playlist, though.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-companies-for-a-data-scientist-to-work-for?top_ans=228864350,2020-07-21T21:34:22.581478+00:00,2020-07-21T21:35:31.193404+00:00,14,Ivan Miller,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ivan-Miller-11
What are good companies or job positions for an aspiring data scientist without a PhD?,"First, I would like to remind you that a Data Scientist is NOT just stats, modeling, and predicting something. This image below is one of my favorite showcasing all of the aspects that it takes to be a self-sufficient data scientist.

We all start somewhere, and when you’re just starting out you should have the overall foundational level and understanding of key concepts of the field you expect to enter, which it sounds like you have from college coursework. In my experience, most people’s opinion of DS is figures 1–4 below through modeling.

There is much experience that you will need to get to put all the parts together, especially around an often overlooked realm of data preparation. Database theory, data modeling, how to clean data for predictive modeling, the proper tools to use, ETL framework, and so on.

“In Data Science we spend 80% of our time on data preparation, and the other 20% complaining about the need for data preparation”

To answer your question of good job positions are ones that help to fill in the holes that you need to complete your skill set. Consider a consulting role, as the project subjects that you work on, the tools you work with, the techniques, work environment, etc. are different at every client. You typically have a team around you to help you learn and grow your skills.

I worked as an Actuary for 10 years developing predictive loss models, then worked at a database company as a solution architect for 3 years in the big data space, and now have been in consulting for the past 3 years. My BS is in Applied Math, and MS in Data Science. I have no PhD, but am a Principal Data Science Consultant working at Fortune 100 companies in the Silicon Valley.

If you’d like, shoot me an email and I’d be happy to talk to you about my current data-focused consulting company I work for off-line and refer you directly. ElmoVT at yahoo dot com. That goes for anyone else reading this as well.

What should you do if you are the first data scientist in a company?,"Entering a new company as the first data scientist is a daunting challenge filled with many obstacles. You have to build trust, and you have to start delivering value as soon as possible, but the organization isn’t set up for you to succeed.

The good news is that if you can go through the 8 steps I outline below, you can put yourself in a good position after all.

1. Introduce yourself to your new colleagues and get to know them. This one should be fairly self-explanatory.
2. Get access to the data. Basically, you want access to all the data you can get your hands on. Databases, file servers, ad-hoc Excel sheets, you name it. This often takes more time than it should, and you might have to remind the right people two or three times before you finally get the access you need.
3. Explore the data. Depending on how well you know the domain, it can take quite some time before you have a basic understanding of the main data sources. This will typically involve talking to domain experts and DBAs (if there are any).
4. Assess the data infrastructure. Do you have the right data and is it properly structured and stored in a sensible way so that you can start data science initiatives? Inevitably, the answer to these questions is going to be a big fat no. Before a company has a data scientist, they have no idea of what kind of data a data scientist needs. You will be horrified and disgusted at what you see, and you will want to change everything.
5. Perform feasibility studies. Now that you know that all your data is useless, it’s time to identify problems that you can solve and how/if you can get the data to solve them. In this phase, you have to talk to managers high up in the company hierarchy. If not, you’ll just end up spending months trying to solve problems that have no business value.
6. Initiate data engineering initiatives. You thought you were a data scientist? Well, think again. For the next few months, you’re going to be a data engineer. If you don’t have the skillset for that, you’re either going to have to convince the company to hire a data engineer, learn how to become one yourself or quit the job. I’m serious. If you don’t get the data infrastructure properly set up at this point, you will fail miserably.
7. Experiment and develop prototype. You have a proper data infrastructure now? Good. You’re past the most difficult part. What you need to do now is attack a small, well-defined problem with clear business value. Hopefully, you have identified such a problem. If not, go back to step 5.
8. Present your findings to managers. Once you find something interesting, you have to show it to the right people. Remember to drop the machine learning lingo and talk plainly and clearly. Good visualizations are important.
If you have successfully achieved all of this, you are in the right position to succeed in your job as the first data scientist. From there, the sky is the limit.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-companies-for-a-data-scientist-to-work-for?top_ans=133161608,2019-04-10T21:35:08.345987+00:00,2019-04-10T21:39:53.045269+00:00,197,Håkon Hapnes Strand,https://www.quora.com/profile/Håkon-Hapnes-Strand

I will be answering this question, keeping in mind that a bunch of readers could be complete newbies into programming.

So addressing non-computer science students. Firstly, you need to work a lot on your problem-solving skills which is going to help you code effortlessly. You can achieve this by learning Data structures & Algorithms and coding in it. Also, DS & Algo are the building block of computer science so it will definitely help you on your Journey towards excellence in coding.

After you are comfortable with problem-solving, you should stick to the below mentioned points:

1. Opt for a good course on Machine learning and study it thoroughly to become well versed with all it’s concepts.
2. Practice machine learning problems on Kaggle: Your Machine Learning and Data Science Community [ https://www.kaggle.com/ ] which will help you gain confidence and give you enough hands-on skills.
3. Post your projects on GitHub, LinkedIn and also you can use youtube to showcase your skills
4. Now it’s Time to market yourself. Make a clean and creative online portfolio and a strong resume based on ML. Start applying to your desired companies and surely circumstances will bend in your favour and soon you will become something you have worked so hard for and that is “Data scientist”
5. you can connect with me on LinkedIn
Ps: I am attaching my photo, in which you can see me working from home, just in case you are interested to know how a data scientist looks?! 😛

"Can I become a data scientist by learning on my own from Coursera, and will I have a job for that?","I usually don’t write on Quora but this question struck a cord, so I wanted to say - “Yes! You most definitely can!” Don’t spend your energy, excitement and enthusiasm wondering whether you can but just do it. I know numerous friends and colleagues who have shifted from non DS roles to DS through self-study, hard work, being proactive in seeking and nailing opportunities. Now:

1. Would Coursera courses be enough? May be, may be not. I think you rather mean - Free online courseware? If yes then for sure, you can use these to learn the fundamentals of DS. My advice would be to start practicing on Kaggle as well, after you have gone through some of the popular coursera courses. Also read books - Finish ISRL (theory + exercise) and then read ESLR (lookup on Google what these are), participate in the blogs/discussions at Kaggle with a growth mindset [don’t waste time showing off/sloshing around in the forums - only participate if you have something to learn or contribute to other’s learning].
2. Also, eventually (not early on), you will have to decide if you want to become a Generalist or a Specialist DS (look it up!) I am sort of a semi-generalist and I arrived at that conclusion by continuously searching for the types of problems that interested me the most. So I would look for the type of DS problems that most fascinated me out of the different available (and that’s why Kaggle is a great starting point with variety of problem types). Think not just about solving the problem but also about “why” and “how” the problem came into being. Data Science is not just about solving problems with a common set of techniques/insights. It is also about dealing with ambiguity and formulating an unknown situation into a solvable problem.
3. Just don’t shy away from the math and the coding. The earlier you become strong theoretically and programming wise, the larger will be your chances to break into the field. Also, stronger your programming skills, less you will have to worry about others helping you with the underlying data engineering.
4. Apply for interviews - or at least read through the different analytics role job descriptions of DS jobs to get familiar with the type of work the industry demands. That will help you better direct your preparation.
5. Don’t be picky. Listen - this is completely my opinion and it’s possible I am wrong, but I believe dream job’s are rare. So if you land a DS job but it’s not exactly what you expected (may be it’s less ML and more PM’ing/Software Engineering), stick with it. If you get a data oriented role and were able to demonstrate your competency at work, soon you will grow into a role where you can literally dictate what you do and how. This is because, your management will believe in you to decide and do things best for the company!
6. Finally, be patient. I know many who literally spent 5 years, learning and churning through jobs to finally become a DS. This is a hot and competitive field, so chances are you will have to sustain your hard work and attempt at breaking into this field for an extended amount of time.
I hope at this point you and other interested readers were little more convinced to try becoming a DS if that’s their goal. By the way, I became a DS without even Coursera’s help. I learn better from books and blogs and kept proactively identifying ways to improve my current organization’s work through Machine Learning. Kept doing this for 2–3 years constant and got my break when I was able to land a major DS project. Was all this worth it? You bet it was!

Good luck!",https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-data-scientists-career-path-1?top_ans=320396629,2021-11-16T02:17:19.005376+00:00,,40,Saptarshi Chaudhuri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Saptarshi-Chaudhuri
How hard is the work of a data scientist?,"It’s an office job. It’s not hard work.

I’ve been watching the HBO series Chernobyl recently, about the 1986 nuclear accident. A team of coal miners were brought in to seal off the nuclear core by digging a tunnel under the power plant. They worked around the clock in deadly levels of radiation and extreme temperatures. They couldn’t set up fans, because that would swirl up radioactive dust.

Now, that’s hard work.

I, on the other hand, sit in a comfortable chair in my office with two large, friendly monitors, sipping a cup of coffee. Sometimes, I eat lunch, play foosball or have an informal chat with colleagues.

As a data scientist, I don’t have hard deadlines to deal with. I’m an experimenter, an explorer. I massage the data and ask it questions. I don’t have to work long evenings to get a new release finished. I release code whenever I have something new. I don’t get called in the middle of the night because some system is down. I monitor the performance of my models and update them if they degrade.

I have to keep up to date with technical knowledge, but learning about new technologies and techniques is what got me into this line of work in the first place. I do it because it’s fun, not because I have to.

Generally speaking, the eight hours I spend at work is the easiest part of my day.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-data-scientists-career-path-1?top_ans=143566632,2019-05-26T10:44:27.425407+00:00,2019-05-28T13:39:01.898175+00:00,3533,Håkon Hapnes Strand,https://www.quora.com/profile/Håkon-Hapnes-Strand
What is a data scientist?,"This is a long…really…long answer. That will allow me to introduce newcomers, recruiters, seasoned professionals, C-level executives to the Data Science world. You need to persist, always. Read until the end, please.

First of all, being a Data Scientist in a small company is TOTALLY DIFFERENT from being a Data Scientist on a multinational/large company. May I repeat? TOTALLY DIFFERENT…We’ll discover why together.

Based on that, check out below my favorite posts about this different perspectives on “how do I feel at work”. It’s clear that the authors described totally different scenarios that can exist between somewhere around a small company and a large corporation.

 * Work in some narrow and closed scope;
 * Large team with each one specialized in some sort of data niche ;
 * “Evangelized” and aligned company;
 * Ps.: there is no right or wrong, if the environment and role are aligned with your profile.
On the other hand, we can still perceive some similarities between both worlds. I remember reading a post on Linkedin along these lines:


%3E Ask the interview candidate about how much time he thinks that will be spent on data modeling.

If he answers more than 20%. Don’t hire.
The fun part is that the post is telling us pretty much the truth.

It’s true that some outliers are working on highly-specialized AI positions at IBM/Facebook/Google research departments, but in the end, for the mortals, its an accurate interview scenario.

Data Scientist main characteristics

When I say main characteristics I need to be clear that we have an assumption that a Data Scientist is already good with math, statistics and computing plus a cherry on the cake, at least one year of experience in some market niche (domain knowledge).

Data Scientists ARE NOT plug and play. You can just unplug a Data Scientist from a cancer research program and plug into a stock market consulting role.

So with all said. That's the basics, that you see everywhere. No need do discuss or reinvent the wheel.

Data Scientists need to convince people of the importance, usefulness and accuracy of their work. Most of posts don’t mention that. Let's think in hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the persuasion need:

1. You show the output of a black-box neural network with maximum precision and recall. Apparently blindly ignoring your numbers, investors don't believe in the results and start an endless Q&A session. They say that they will invest millions of dollars on the idea only after a clear understanding of assumptions and a successful experiment…and so on.
2. Try to explain what is a moving average to a salesperson? They are supposed to know the difference between median, mean an mode, right? Or some basic thing like quartiles and a tricky question about bagplots. Probably by now, you noticed that there is a inherent evangelism role for every data science position. Tools are only good if people are using them. You can provide a set of outputs, predictions and reports, but they are useless if people don't understand or use. Adoption, adoptio…adoption!
3. You schedule a Friday meeting to transfer knowledge from Data Science to other departments like sales, marketing, maintenance and accounting. You have a naive goal to explain and teach what is a Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Taylor series, Laplace transforms. Near the end of the meeting, when you realize, people will be dead or in a coma. They were killed by boringness. Data is a bunch of fun only for data guys, remember it. A more successful approach would be to teach integrals by referring to them as the area below the curve. Geometry instead of algebric, Socrates! Visual communication instead of just words or equations.
So let’s face it. We (analytical people) speak a different language and it needs to be translated into the world’s lingua franca. Otherwise, no one will listen, or even worse, they will pretend to listen and understand.

By now you are supposed to be convinced that one of the most important characteristics of a Data Scientist is “evangelism”, “sell your fish”. Not everyone can abandon “gut feelings” and be “data-driven” by themselves.

There is another characteristics related do evangelism present in most of the well-know and seasoned Data Scientists. They can communicate very complex concepts in a way that people will understand (or maybe get a grasp of the actual meaning).

Old versus new

You can be lucky to start working in a new company with all that fresh mentality of Business Intelligence, KPIs, predictive and prescriptive analytics, real-time dashboards, data access to everyone and the AI term being used every where (when actually is just machine learning. I forgive you, marketing department!).

Or…
You can start to work for a +100 years law company where your main job will be to convince others that your work is valuable and it’s not just another “hype/trend” being followed by a managerial decision.

The dream of every company, the central data repository of truth and a data-driven mindset can only be achieved with everyone embracing this long-term mission. A Data Scientist, can be the facilitator, a virus (in a good sense), but the virus needs to proliferate (create allies) in order to facilitate “fever” to shake down things.

Domain Expertise/Knowledge

There was a competition for improving the Paypal fraud detection. In the middle of all the Kaggle obsession with algorithms, the company responsible for developing the winning solution was very clear. They didn’t use any fancy algorithm or a deep neural network with thousands of hidden layers. They only used their past acquired experience of 10 years working with fraudulent transactions.

It’s really important to understand this concept. People think in Data Scientists as the “joker”card, a wildcard character. It's true that some abilities that rely on programming, logic thinking and math/stats are portable to different industries. However, the domain expertise is highly related to the industry that the Data Scientist has more familiarity and years of work.


%3E This is not supposed to be a new concept, right? It’s been that way for all the history of humankind, for all professionals.
The problem is that some people took the “generalization” of certain intelligent models too seriously, as granted. Then, they applied to everything and everyone without restrictions.

A Data Scientist with 5 years experience with banking will be totally different from one that spent one decade researching cancer. Different technology stacks (R or Python) and/or different approaches for similar problems. They can be interchangeable, but the learning curve is significant and painful. This needs to be take into account (special attention for HR recruiters reading this paragraph).

Data Science is all about controversy

I don’t personally like these two answers below, but I think that it’s good to read them to hear different opinions about Data Scientists.

 * Michael Hochster [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Hochster ]'s anwser about Data Scientists, basically defines two types. Type A (Analysis) and Type B (Build) Data Scientists.
I disagree with that statement. When I say disagree, I mean REALLY disagree. The main reason it’s that the definition is too simplistic. The data market will not evolve with terms like type B or type A.


%3E “Hey, I’ve just landed a job position as Data Scientist Type B at the TypeC Company”.
This is well aligned to the trend of IT industry of calling people by uninspired terms liks “architect” or “engineer”. You can be a “software engineer or a database architect”, but if you have a computer science bachelors you are a “computer scientist”, not the single-word term “engineer”. I'm a mechanical engineer, thus an engineer. Same thing for architects. They are…architects, simple as stated, architects.

Yes, it’s good to discuss about these picky things for us to not lose control.

Another idea that I disagree but its good to understand is the conception from Ingo Mierswa [ https://rapidminer.com/author/ingo/ ]: Founder & President of RapidMiner.


%3E Data scientists are people who apply all those analytical techniques and the necessary data preparation in the context of a business application.
Let’s go back to the case of an independent Data Scientist researcher fighting big corporations, mining data and trying to extract patterns that will help to cure cancer. I certainly think that it's not on the context of “business applications”.

Does a Data Scientist develop products or product features?

Another great missconception. I really liked my summer internship at Cognitive Class  [ https://cognitiveclass.ai/ ](IBM Canada), because we were not developing products. We were developing courses and exploring algorithms and data.

Yes, you can improve the gamified leaderboard of an app. No problem with that, but we can’t confine Data Scientists to work only with products.

As of today, I founded a consultancy company that have Data Scientist working with consulting and products.

The result of a Data Scientist analysis can affect a business decision, can motivate someone to change his/her career (like some of my posts and based on the private feedback that I'm receiving), endorse a hiring budget and many other possibilities. It doesn’t need to be a product, it can be a service to external and/or internal clients!

Does A Data Scientist works near business, money flow, “plata”?


%3E “It's All About the Money, Honey! ”
Okay, now you want to talk about business.

Data Scientists working on Bussiness Intelligence, Strategy Consulting, banking and finance can have high-paying careers. The downside is that we can’t take only these profiles into account to define a whole group of professionals.

Let’s get some data if we're talking about money:

Ref.: Oreilly 2016 data science salary survey [ http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/2016-data-science-salary-survey.pdf ]

Sometimes I can get astonishined by seing how the Central limit theorem  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem ]really works for when you have a large  [ https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/269/what-is-the-difference-between-a-population-and-a-sample ]sample of your population.
The survey looks approximately as a “Bell Curve” (aka Normal distribution [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution ]) with the mean around 100k ~120k US Dollars.

A lot of money!

We are getting closer on this post to find out why some companies are willing to pay that much for Data Scientists (if you are not convinced yet, remember, this is just the AVERAGE)

Definitions

it’s not only one, you are dealing with Data Science [ https://www.quora.com/What-is-data-science/answer/Luis-Martins-200 ]. Your eyes need to bleed for things start making sense.

After this long post, I’ll share my proposal that is more aligned with what I’ve seen around my feed and what, at the same time, makes more sense (at least for me):

Data Engineer

 * Extract, transform and loads data from all types of sources
 * Maintain pipelines and databases (Some overlap with a DBA [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_administrator ])
 * Interface between back-end/database team and Data Scientists team
Machine Learning Practitioner/Specialist/Engineer

 * Data Modeling. If the company is large enough, works only developing models;
 * Create containers to make the models “production ready”;
 * Test, Learn and deploy new algorithms (
 * 
 * There is a lot of algorithms to learn, believe me, just Artificial Neural Networks would take all the 71.5 years of average life expectancy for a human being to be properly learned;

 * Optimization
Data Analyst/Business Analyst

 * Can be related to business, but not necessarily;
 * Can consume data from the models generated by the Machine Learning Practitioner or straight from data pipelines developed by Data Engineers;
 * Share insights with plain english.
Mathematicians and statisticians

 * Do everything that a Machine Learning Practitioner does but without all the glamour and hype;
 * Propose experiments to prove or reprove hypothesis (e.g. A/B Testing).
Data Scientist (The unicorn, The Asymptote [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote ], The GOAL!)

 * + 10 years of experience
 * Needs to have experience and proven knowledge in all the roles above and be capable of temporarily acting as one of the described positions, if in need. Doesn't mean that should;
 * The glue that put’s everything together;
 * Direct report to upper management level (if in a business context);
 * Domain expertise focus
Okay, One last chance for those of you that missed the Integral and differential Calculus [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus ] class.

I like to think in the following way to don’t get too depressed while facing what a Data Scientist could know. To stay with sanity, I focus on what I should know and work to get better on that.

Ref.: my Wacom

According to my own theory (US Patent pending), the Data Scientist Goal is an Red Dashed Asymptote, something that these blue and green lines will never achieve or get to know what is like.

… Blue curve is a data professional working and studying 14hrs/day
… Green curve is a data professional working and studying 8hrs/day

The only difference is the rate that they learn and evolve. The sad part is that both will not reach the Data Scientist Goal.

This approach is similar to:


%3E “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” - Norman Vincent Peale, author of The Power of Positive Thinking.
After 1x Human life we start to see the prediction of the blue line. To give the blue one a chance, let’s suppose that this poor data professional is actually immortal!

Then, surprisingly, we'll have the dashed blue lines (projection) that still won’t touch the Data Scientist Goal due to the mathematical nature of asymptotes. Theoretically, in the end of its immortality, this blue data professional would be a complete and up to date Data Scientist unicorn .

I hope that this post familiarize you with lots of technical terms that you will face along the way if you are pursuing a data science career, planning to hire someone or invest in Data Science.

Ps.: asymptotes are not supposed to be new for you if you are planning to pursue an analytical career.

It's crucial that you know what your goals are before deciding on an institute; this will help you find the best fit.

How do I become a data scientist?

 * The first step towards becoming a data scientist is understanding what the job entails.
 * Data scientists are able to handle big data sets with ease, often through programming languages like Python or R, but they must also have excellent written communication skills to work with non-technical audiences.
If you're interested in becoming a data scientist, it's important that you have strong quantitative skills. This includes being proficient in mathematics and statistics as well as having an understanding of probability and large numbers.

Data scientists are always at the forefront of innovation, so it's important to stay up-to-date on new developments in your field of interest. Technology moves quickly these days, so make sure you are staying informed of changes by reading blogs and publications within your industry.

Tips for breaking into the field of data science:

Yes, you can become a data scientist. However, it's not as simple as sitting down and reading a book. In order to break into this field, there are a few things you need to know.

The first thing to do is educate yourself on data science skills. You may need to brush up on your math skills or learn an entirely new programming language. There are many institutes that offer data science courses online for different domains within data science.

When should I enroll in a data science institute?

There is no set time for when you should enroll in a data science program. If you are interested in the subject and want to learn more, it's never too soon!

However, if you want to use your degree as a stepping stone into a career, there are certain institutes that are best to get started for you.

This institute is an online learning institute that provides data science courses in Bangalore for working professionals who want to make the most of their time. They are an organization that helps individuals use data to solve problems.

Advanced Data Science and AI Program

 * 7 Months Weekday
 * 9 Months Weekend
 * 250+ Hours of training
Here are five reasons why you should make this institute your first choice for a Data Science Institute:

 * Online learning has become a major part of the education system. And while this format offers many benefits, it also requires instructors to be experts in a particular topic. One way to increase your expertise is through domain specialization.
Domain Specialization: One will be trained in various domain electives like human resources, banking, BFSI, telecommunication, manufacturing, etc to meet the requirements of the specialization in a particular given field. This specialty Advance Data Science and AI program adds value to your CV and allows students to master domain-specific training.

 * After completing the course, one would also be eligible for IBM certifications. As it is a part of the Advance Data Science and AI program, one will receive certificates for completion courses, multiple competence certifications, and for completing all the projects.
 * Programmers and non-programmers looking to learn and initiate their learning will benefit from the non-programmer support feature and guidance that this institute provides.
 * As the pace of business continues to accelerate, it is important that we as knowledge workers take on capstone and real-time projects that are cross-functional and require creativity. In order to do this, we need a variety of skill sets and competencies.
Some of the projects included are:

 * 
 * Forecasting the uber demand
 * Netflix’s library of films
 * Amazon product reviews
 * Tracking human activity

 * A hybrid learning environment mixes traditional classroom instruction with online academic courses and real-world projects for students who prefer an applied approach to their academic study.
 * Use the interactive, real-time learning resources provided by Project Innovation Lab at your convenience. There are project innovation centers in at least seven Indian cities, including Delhi, Pune, and others, where experts from MNCs and MAANG assist with both online and offline project sessions.
One of the best data science institutes in Delhi is Simplilearn. Simplilearn provides an array of courses for aspiring data scientists, from basic to advanced levels. The company also offers a range of certifications, so you can rest assured that the classes you take will help you advance your career. However, the course does not offer a variety of domains in its domain specialization feature.

Coursera offers MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) in data science. These online courses are free and offer an introduction to the subject matter for those who are interested. But, the course does not have live and interactive sessions.

Conclusion

Data science is an ever-growing field and it's time to jump in and get started!

What is data science?,"
%3E Data science is searching for a diamond in a coal mine. Yes, it is as straightforward as that. Diamond is the result, and coal mine is the collected data.
Definitions, flow charts and articles about “what is data science” sometimes cause confusion. It is okay, and there are many aspects of data science. If a person learns every aspect of data science, they will likely forget many aspects within a week. The data science field is very vast, and you need skills and experience to be called a proficient data scientist. The experience one requires to be domain-oriented.

We are glad to live in a world full of information. You can have the freedom to learn whatever you want.. However, in data science, you must know the reason for choosing it as a career. When your reason is strong enough, and you face any setbacks or challenges, it will keep you on track. Another important task before stepping into data science is knowing which domain you want to grow your expertise in.

I will help you learn everything about data science. What direction should you take in your professional life? What will your responsibilities be as a data scientist? What is the most effective data science training programme?

It doesn't matter how you learn data science; doing projects is the most important factor. Projects will give you a practical understanding of data science. Many beginners and experts compete on kaggle performing projects, which is fun. To make your profile stand out, a project experience is more essential than a top university certificate.

The roadmap to getting started as a data scientist are:

1. Knowing the reason for choosing data science
2. Choosing domain of interest
3. Learning the basics of must-have skills
4. Implementing gained skills on real projects
5. Getting relevant experience in the main domain
6. Earning a recognized certificate
7. Preparing for the interview and scoring a job.
These are ideal steps every data scientist has followed. As the experience increases, your expertise will grow. You can also switch to different domains of interest.

Day to day task you would be performing in data science:

There are four types of tasks you would be performing such as collecting and cleaning the data, insight generation, performing ML algorithms, and communicating with managers or clients.

Collecting and cleaning the data: The data collection and cleansing seems easy, but data scientists have to spend days on this process. In a project, when you perform, you get created and clean data, but in real life, working as a data scientist, you need to collect and clean the data independently.

Insight generation: This step defines the quality of a data scientist. Deriving the useful insight from cleaned data makes a data scientist creative and gameplay of the strategies. In this step, mathematical, statistical and visualization come into use.

ML algorithm: In this, a data scientist feeds the computer insightful collected data. The methods used in ML algorithms are recommender system, supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision problems.

Communication: This is the process of expression; a data scientist explains the created strategies to managers or clients. Explaining complex data in a simple way, a data scientist needs in-depth understanding. Of course, these things get improved over time, but you should also be improving your communication skills.

What qualities separate great data scientists from good data scientists?,"I have had the pleasure to work with a few exceptional data scientists (with some of them way back when it was not even called data science) and I have worked with plenty good ones. What they all had in common: self-sufficient coding, good ‘tech’ communication, solid statistics knowledge, predictive modeling background, and data experience.

But what made the 4 great ones great?

Insatiable curiosity, healthy amount of common (business) sense, deep rooted scepticism, and finally some form of sixth sense when it came to data. Two of them were statisticians, the other two computer scientists. They are also the only 4 people in the world whose findings I will trust blindly. (Did I mention skepticism?)

These things are all closely interconnected. What makes them so vital is one of the biggest challenges in data science: Quality control. How sure are you that what you just build is good? That the analysis you just did truly generalizes to the question you are supposed to answer?

The reality is that even I often have a vague feeling at best how close I have come to ‘the truth’ or let’s say to the best that can be done. I do not know if tinkering another week will improve the performance of my model by 0 or by 25%. I do not know the probability with which digging for another hour or two I will discover that my data had a huge sampling problem. I do not know. And I am the one who build it! In data science we are constantly dealing with the nagging feeling that we do not know about something we don’t know.

The only hope is, that I have found 90% of all the mistakes in my analysis because I know the data as well as humanly possibly, I have rejected the first 10 answers I got, I have this sense that tells me when things look too good to be true. My model can predict the probability that somebody clicks on an ad with 95% certainty? I doubt it! Is this overfitting? No I actually had duplicates in my training set (this is different from the classical sense of overfitting) … how did they get there?

It is not sufficient to deal with the symptom … if there were duplicates where none should have been - I need to go back and UNDERSTAND how they got there … Chances are, wherever there was one problem, there will be more …

My model’s performance doubles and all I did was retrain it on a more recent time period? Not likely… I need to find the cause. Unfortunately it was not that we had new and better features, but instead we discovered ad-fraud.

The best indicator of somebody shopping for jewelry on Amazon is that they have no prior purchases? Possible (you would not believe how many people will come up with nice stories why this might be true …) but rather unlikely! In fact - this is a subtle sampling problem - in order to be in the Amazon database you must have bought something - and so a clear indication of buying jewelry is being in the database and not having any other purchases.

The patient identifier is really good at predicting who has breast cancer? Either you are a terrible data scientist OR something is wrong with the data (it was, the data had originated from 4 different locations with different patient number systems and different base rates).

Can you learn this? Maybe, if you are curious and have a great mentor. But more than anything, it is who you are.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-data-scientists-career-path-1?top_ans=27482452,2016-09-06T21:39:12.094181+00:00,2016-09-16T15:25:49.377436+00:00,363,Claudia Perlich,https://www.quora.com/profile/Claudia-Perlich

It additionally offers help for different DS activities through its bountiful libraries.

SQL

SQL is prominently alluded to as the bread and butter of DS. It happens in the beginning degrees of DS activity. SQL is fundamentally utilised for extricating and recovering information. It is likewise mindful to oversee information that is put away in a social data set. SQL is basically utilised uniquely for taking care of organised information.

Big Data

It is a significant innovation that is a little section of DS. Large Data innovations like Hadoop, Spark, Apache Flink have surprised the world because of their gigantic information stockpiling and handling capacities. Since an information researcher needs to manage enormous volumes of information, information on Big Data is fundamental.

Java

Java is a notable programming language acknowledged by numerous enterprises. In this day and age, Java is needed by each and every other organisation, regardless of its size. The information on Java permits you to tune and keep up with enormous information stages like Hadoop which are written in a similar language.

Utilising the Right Learning assets

Since you have perceived everything about DS, it's time you arm yourself with the learning assets. In any case, the greater inquiry which emerges here is, the place where to observe the real source which you can depend on? In this way, here is a rundown of learning sources that will assist you with examining and turning into an information researcher.

Learning Resource 1: Start taking Projects

What is a data scientist's career path?,"Working as a data scientist can be one of the most exciting and rewarding jobs today. All top MNCs like Accenture, Cisco, AT&T, Netflix, Amazon, etc. have a need for data scientists who can provide them with accurate business intelligence.

As of 2022, 29% of all organizations globally had more than 100 data scientists working for them. This is a massive proportion, considering the global labor pool and diversity in the kind of jobs that are available.

How does a data scientist’s career begin?

You can begin your career in data science as a Junior Data Scientist. You could even be working as a Data Engineer, Data Administrator, Data Architect, etc. All the roles come under the umbrella of data science and there is a lot of overlap in the responsibilities of the role.

Some common tasks that are expected of a junior-level data scientist are:

1. Data Extraction - For a given project, you have to extract data from the relevant sources and store it in a data warehouse for further processing. This method is called ETL (extract, transform, and load) and is the first step in any data science project.
2. Data Cleaning - Once you have the data in the warehouse, you have to apply data mining techniques to it to begin your analysis.
3. Database Management - Another one of the responsibilities at the initial stages of a data science project is to extract and manipulate data as needed from the database using relevant query languages like SQL or MongoDB.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - This is the point where you begin to work on the data to solve the actual problem presented to you.
5. Data Modeling and/or Data Visualization - This is the step where you begin to implement your analytical models on the data, now that you have made sense of it.
As you can see, the tasks of a junior data scientist are spread across the entire spectrum of DS skills and tools so you need to have a thorough understanding of how a data science project works. This is why if you are about to start learning DS to build a career in this field, you should make sure that along with the theoretical knowledge you also gain some project experience during your course.

What comes next?

The next level in the career of a data scientist is that of a Senior Data Scientist or a Lead Data Scientist, where you will be leading a team of junior data scientists and other data engineers.

Some examples of the kind of projects that you could be handling are -

 * Building a model for credit risk management
 * Implementing optimization models for inventory control
In this stage, you will also be responsible for ensuring the quality of data that is mined, and for distributing the tasks among the junior data scientists under you.

The next steps - Senior Management

Finally, after enough experience and career growth, you will be promoted to senior management-level positions like Director, Vice President, Chief Data Officer, etc. To get here you need a lot of hard work and dedication.

You might feel lost considering the breadth of responsibilities that come with a data science role, but you don't have to worry. Keep your focus on the first steps and on making the right start. There are many institutes that will help you with this.

I’ll list a few below for reference:

Coursera is an online educational resource that provides students with the chance to learn from industry professionals in a fun and engaging setting. Coursera also offers certificate programs in Data Analytics. Professionals may also learn a great deal about data science on this platform, which provides a number of credentials and allows instructors the opportunity to teach. However, this institute's lack of domain specialty characteristics for its students is a significant downside.

It offers a variety of data science courses for beginners and working professionals. These courses give guidance from professionals in live classrooms where you may ask questions and receive immediate responses. In the event that you have any questions about your career or the course, you may receive career counseling from MAANG professionals who will help you determine the best course of action.

They have many features that make them the best.

A few are as follows:

 * Their courses for working professionals emphasize domain expertise above anything else. In the Advanced Data Science and AI Program, you can specialize in many fields such as E-commerce, Banking, E-commerce, Mechanical, Automotive, Healthcare, IT, and many more.
 * The courses feature real-world industry and culminating projects. You will work on these projects in real-time, on-site, with the assistance of mentors.
Some examples of these projects like in the Advance Data Science and AI Program are:

 * 
 * Hybrid Recommender System
 * Image Classifier
 * House Price Prediction

The Advanced Data Science and AI Program consists of 12 real-time and 2 capstone projects. These will assist you in gaining practical industrial experience.

 * After completing the course, you will have access to extra resources to further your education. It also offers Hybrid Learning sessions for students who wish to apply what they have learned while working on real-world projects.
 * These courses result in an IBM certification, which is helpful in interviews. In the Advance Data Science and AI Program, for instance, both an IBM course completion certificate and a Capstone project completion certificate are awarded. In addition, a Micro-skills certificate is awarded upon completion of micro-skills training in Data Science Tools, Data Science Methodology, Data Science and AI, and a number of other topics.
 * In several sites around the nation, you may perform assignments under the supervision of MAANG professionals in project innovations labs. The four cities of Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Pune are among the seven locations.
Conclusion

I would suggest that you get a data science certification from the above mentioned institutes only.

Are you a self-made data scientist? How did you do it?,"Yes, I think I qualify to answer this question. Prior to my current role at Kabbage, I had a (sucessful) 8 year long career in designing graphics, mobile and server processors. The entire process took nearly a year with my interview period lasting roughly 2–3 months. I ended up attending 5 interviews on site and had offers from 3. Here is my story.

The Motivation Phase (1 month)

As a computer engineering graduate, I had shockingly minimal exposure to statistics and no exposure to machine learning. Initially, the buzz around data science in the tech media got me interested in the area. I pored over blogs, news media and articles online trying to define to myself the idea of a ‘data scientist’ and what makes one successful in the role. This included exploring stories about data science making a difference in diverse fields from healthcare to recruiting to marketing to education to everything in between. Gradually, the hype turned to genuine potential in my mind. This phase of setting the motivation was hugely important and set up the intrinsic drive to succeed. Otherwise, it would have been highly likely that I would have given up the endeavor before seeing it through to the end.

Next, I set out to figure out the skills required to become a data scientist. The most popular idea on the net is that a data scientist is a super-human who sits at the intersection of programming, statistical (and ML), math, business domain and communication skills. Additionally, I would also like to throw in familiarity with big data tools like Hadoop/Spark/AWS to the mix based on my experience. I could only check off the software engineering skills (hacking skills) in this Venn diagram! One of my primary complaints with my prior job as a computer architect was that I felt that my learning curve was saturating. With such a vast skills requirement, I knew that there would always something new for me to learn for a very long time!

The Knowledge Phase (9 months)

The knowledge phase involved signing up for and completing a number of courses online through Udacity [ https://www.udacity.com/ ] (U), Coursera [ https://www.coursera.org/ ] (C) and edX [ https://www.edx.org/ ] (E). While Coursera was somewhat dry and theoretical and focused on the traditional lecture format, both Udacity and EdX focussed on a more interactive learning experience with short videos and tons of built in quizzes and programming questions to help with learning by doing. While this phase lasted a long time, it was because there were huge knowledge gaps to fill. I was also mostly taking these classes in the evenings or weekends after my regular work hours aka spare time. My focus was on statistics, machine learning, exploratory data analysis and some advanced topics (since I already had the programming and software engineering skills from my prior job).

List of classes I took but not necessarily in that order (not just skim, but actually complete all the lectures, assignments and mini-projects for the most part):

1. Descriptive and Inferential Statistics (U) - Critical
2. Machine Learning by Sebastian Thrun (U) - Critical/Practical
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (U) - Critical
4. A/B Testing (U) - Nice to Know
5. Recommender Systems (C) - Nice to Know
6. Text Mining and Analytics (C) - Skimmed/Nice to Know
7. Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (C) - Critical/Theoretical
8. Introduction to Hadoop (U) - Critical/Nice to know
9. Introduction to Big Data (E) - Critical/Nice to know
10. Big Data Analysis with Apache Spark (E) - Nice to know
11. Algorithms I & II (C) - Mostly for interview purposes
The Skill Building Phase (6 months)

This was a super interesting phase.

After arming myself with the necessary fundamentals and practical tools (Python, R, mathematical and statistical base), it was time to put them to work. Enter Kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/ ]. For those not in the know, Kaggle is an online competitive platform for budding and experienced data scientists. Its a chance to get your hands dirty with real datasets from real companies to solve real problems using insights gleaned from data. Most of all, it is a vibrant community of like minded people having fun and learning from each other. Kaggle was single handedly successful in teaching me the nuances of experiment design, data pre-processing, feature engineering, model validation, and ensemble building. The gamification of the task at hand (leaderboard, rankings, forums etc) made the experience hugely rewarding and fun at the same time. Not to mention that you can use your achievements on Kaggle to get recruiter eyeballs. For more details on this, see: Vijay Sathish's answer to Do recruiters really care about Kaggle achievements or successfully completed courses in Coursera? [ https://www.quora.com/Do-recruiters-really-care-about-Kaggle-achievements-or-successfully-completed-courses-in-Coursera/answer/Vijay-Sathish ]

The second phase of the skills building involved trying to get my hands dirty with real world data science projects. One of the drawbacks with Kaggle is that the problem is already defined, the data is provided to you (and mostly in clean format), and success is defined. In the real world, translating a business problem into a data science task, identifying data sources, extracting the data from multiple sources, data cleaning, defining metrics for success, find ground truth or labels are equally critical tasks. The model building and validation part is probably the easiest task. I identified several problem areas in my field at Oracle related to processor workload analysis, performance coverage analysis, and workload sampling - defined the problem, identified the datasets and metrics and got to work using supervised. unsupervised learning techniques and visualizations to tackle the issues at hand. Most of my team being fellow computer architects had minimal or no experience in machine learning, so this was unchartered territory. The insights I brought to the table from a different perspective was hugely rewarding and my colleagues looked at me with new respect. I was essentially disrupting computer architecture within the team! This also further strengthened my resolve to pursue data science as a full time job.

The Interview Phase (3 months)

The interview phase is the signaling phase. It is about signaling to the recruiter that you have the skills required on paper and convincing your future manager and team mates that you can execute on those skills on the job. The Kaggle achievements (my profile: VijaySathish | Kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/vijaysathish/competitions ] and see: Vijay Sathish's answer to How can a beginner train for machine learning contests? What are the fundamental ideas, tools, and information resources I need to start building expertise in machine learning? [ https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-beginner-train-for-machine-learning-contests-What-are-the-fundamental-ideas-tools-and-information-resources-I-need-to-start-building-expertise-in-machine-learning/answer/Vijay-Sathish ]) and my data science projects at work helped garner the attention of recruiters and get my foot in the door. My theoretical grounding from the coursework and all the experience picked up from actually executing the various data science projects helped convince my interviewers.

I applied for interviews in discrete waves. This means that I would apply to 10–15 companies per week and wait for responses. If I got 2–3 responses, I would stop applying for sometime, otherwise I would apply for another handful next week. I also focused on the skills required of the job, and the specific industry while applying because the job ‘Data Scientist’ can take on a surprisingly wide range of possibilities depending on the company. (For example, a job description that included prior experience of NLP, deep learning or computer vision would be outside my expertise /skills, while a job that primarily involved querying databases, A/B testing or product analytics felt more like a traditional analyst role which was not what I was looking for.) I mostly used AngelList [ https://angel.co/ ] and LinkedIn to apply for data science jobs and focussed on medium stage startups. Early stage startups typically have little or no software infrastructure setup, so you would spend most of your time on software engineering rather than data science tasks. This is fine for some people, but this was not my primary focus for my first data science job. Big companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc. have a higher bar and it would be almost impossible to even get past the recruiter stage given their vast candidate pool.

Data Science is an upcoming field and attracts professionals from diverse fields. The single most important skill in the interview (and perhaps also at work) is storytelling. You are the best person to market yourself. Highlight your competencies, your motivation for the job and what you can bring to the table. Wrap an interesting narrative around your favorite project. On my phone screen with my (to be) manager at Kabbage, I started with the story of solving the problem of computational resources and time for the company. I explained how I used workload clustering to pick and choose representative workloads from a huge workload space to monitor for weekly performance regressions and brought down computation requirements by 10x. I explained how I used our in-house performance simulator and our experiment logs to extract the data for this study. I could tell that my manager started very skeptical (because she was new to the field of computer architecture), but by the end, she came away very impressed with my effort. I can say that I had won more than 50% of the battle by that point.


In summary, transitioning to data science from a lateral field required immense patience, but it was also an extremely rewarding journey for me in the end. (On transitioning, see: Vijay Sathish's answer to Should I start as a Data Analyst or Software Engineer to become a Data Scientist? [ https://www.quora.com/Should-I-start-as-a-Data-Analyst-or-Software-Engineer-to-become-a-Data-Scientist/answer/Vijay-Sathish ])

What are the key skills of a data scientist?,"Truth be told first - even if it disappoints many people -the industry does not have an agreed upon definition of a data scientist! 

Jokes like 'a data scientist is a data analyst living in the Silicon Valley' are abundant. Below is one such cartoon, just for fun.



Finding an 'effective' data scientist is hard and finding people who understand who a data scientist is equally hard. Note the use of 'effective' here, I use it to highlight that there could be people who might possess some of these skills yet may not be the best fit in a data science role. Irony is that even the people looking for hiring data scientists do not know who a data scientist is. Hiring managers post job descriptions for traditional data analyst and business analyst roles while the title calling it a 'Data Scientist' role.  

Everything that I say below is my experience working in a data scientist role with a major search engine and advertising platform. Instead of giving a bullet list of skills, I would first highlight the difference between some data related roles. 

Consider the following scenario. Shop-Mart and Bulk-Mart are two competitors in selling retail. Some higher up in the management chain asks this question: ""How many Shop-Mart customers also go to Bulk-Mart?"". 

[Please note that the question might be of interest to Bulk-Mart management or even a third party, possibly a market research or consumer behavior company, interested in shopping behavior of the population.]



Here is how different data-related roles will approach the problem. This 

Traditional BI/Reporting Professional: Generate reports from structured data using SQL and some kind of reporting services (SSRS for instance) and send the data back to management. The management asks more questions based on the data that was sent and cycle continues. Insights about data are most likely not included in the reports. A person in this role will be experienced mostly in database related skills.

Data Analyst: In addition to doing what the BI guy did, a data analyst will also keep other factors like seasonality, segmentation and visualization in mind. What about if certain trends in shopping behavior are tied to seasonality? What if the trends are different across gender, demographics, geography, product category? A data analyst will slice and dice the data to understand and annotate the report with it. Besides database skills, a data analyst will have a understanding of some of the common visualization tools.

Business Analyst: A business analyst possess the skills that the BI and data analysts have plus domain knowledge and understanding of the business. A business analyst may also have some basic skills in forecasting etc.

Data Mining or Big Data Engineer: Do what the data analyst did, possibly from unstructured data if needed. MapReduce and other big data skills may be needed. Understands the common issues in running jobs on large scale data and is able to debug the jobs. 

Statistician (A traditional one): Pull the data from a DB or obtain it from any of the roles mentioned above and run appropriate statistical tests. Ensure the quality of data and correctness of the conclusions by using standard practices like choosing the right sample size, confidence level, level of significance, type of test etc. 
The situation has changed a bit recently. Statistics departments at most schools have evolved in way that statisticians graduate with strong programming and decent foundation skills in CS enabling them to do the tasks that statisticians traditionally were not trained in.

Program/Project Manager: Look at the data provided by the professionals mentioned so far, align business with the findings and influence the leadership to take appropriate action. Possesses communication skills, presentation skills and can influence without authority.
Ironically the person a PM is influencing business decisions using the data and insights provided by others. If the person does not have a knack for understanding data, chances are that the person will not be able to influence others to take the correct decisions. 


Now putting it altogether.

The rise of online services has brought a paradigm shift in software development life cycle and how business iterate over successive features and products. Having a different data puller, analyst, statistician and project manager is just now possible any more. The mantra now is ship, experiment and learn, adapt, ship, experiment and learn .... This situation has resulted in the birth of a new role - ' A Data Scientist'

A data scientist should have the skills of all the individuals I have mentioned so far. In addition to the skills mentioned above, a data scientist should have rapid prototyping and programming, machine learning, visualization and hacking skills. 

Domain Knowledge and Soft Skills Are As Important as Technical Skills:
The importance of domain knowledge and soft skills like communication and influencing without authority are severely under-estimated both by hiring managers and aspiring data scientists. Insights without domain knowledge can potentially mislead the consumers of these insights. Correct insights without the ability to influence the decision making is as bad as having no insights.

All of what I have said above is based on my own tenure as a data scientist at a major search engine and later the advertising platform within the same company. I learnt that sometimes people asking the question may not know what they want to know - sounds preposterous - yet happens way too often. Very often a bozo will start rat holing into something that is not related to the issue at hand - just to prove that he/she is relevant. A data scientist encounters such HIPPOS (Highly Paid Person's Opinion) that are somewhat unrelated to the problem if not complete nonsense very often. A data scientist should posses the right soft skills to manage situations where people ask irrelevant, distracting or outside of scope questions. This is hard, especially in situations where the person asking the question is several levels up in the corporate ladder and is known to have an ego. It is a data scientist's responsibility to manage up and around while presenting and communicating insights. 

Below is a summary of necessary skills a data scientist should possess in my opinion.

Curiosity About Data and Passion for Domain: If you are not passionate about the domain/business and curious about  data then it is unlikely that you will succeed in a data scientist role. If you are working as a data scientist with an online retailer, you should be hungry all the time to crunch and munch from the Smörgåsbord (of data of course) to know more. If your curiosity does not keep you awake, no skill in the world can help you succeed. 

Soft Skills: Communication and influencing without authority. Understanding of what is the minimum that has the maximum impact. Too many findings are as bad as no findings at all.   Ability to scoop information out of partners and customers, even from the unwilling ones is extremely important. The data you are looking for may not be sitting in one single place. You may have to beg, borrow, steal and do whatever it takes to get the data.

Being a good story teller is also something that helps. Sometimes the insights obtained from data are counter-intuitive, if you are not a good story teller, it will be difficult to convince your audience.

Math/Theory: Machine Learning. Stats and Probability 101. Optimization would be icing on the cake.

CS/Programming: At least one scripting language (I prefer python). Decent algorithms and DS skills, to be able to write code that can analyze a lot of data efficiently. You may not be a production code developer but should be able write code that does not suck. Database management and SQL skills. Knowledge of a statistical computing package, most people including myself prefer R. A spread sheet software like excel.

Big Data and Distributed Systems: Understanding of basic MapReduce concepts, Hadoop and Hadoop file system and least one language like Hive/Pig. Some companies have their own proprietary implementations of these languages. Knowledge of tools like Mahout and any of the xaaS like Azure and AWS would be helpful. Once again big companies have their own xaaS so you may be working on variants of any of these.

Visualization: Ability to create simple yet elegant and meaningful visualization. In my case, R packages like ggplot, lattice and others have helped me in most cases but there are other packages that you can use. In some cases, you might want to use D3. 


Below is a visualization of high level description of skills needed to become a data scientist.


Where is a data scientist in the big data pipeline?
Here is a nice visualization of the big data pipeline, the associated technologies and the regions of operation. In general the depiction of where the data scientist belongs in this pipeline is largely correct, there is one caveat however. A data scientist should be comfortable to dive into the 'Collect' and 'Store' territories if needed. Usually  data scientists would be working on transformed data and beyond but in scenarios where the business does cannot afford to wait for the transformation process to complete, a data scientist has to turn to raw data to gather insights.

What is a data scientist's career path?,"The most in-demand profession of the twenty-first century: ""Data Scientist"". However, the role has been exaggerated to the point of absurdity. It's too misleading, and unfortunately, about 55% of Ds aspirants fail to start a successful data science career, even after having profitable eligibility for the same.

A career in data science isn't just about being a ‘data scientist’, though. As an alternative, there are numerous other roles to consider. Even so, not everyone is a good fit for every role.

Hence, it's better to discuss data scientists' career paths; let's direct the same toward DS career trajectories.

At the very beginning, I must say, the career path will not be the same for all. It solely depends on your present career stage and past qualification background.

Usually, a DS career path might look like as follows:

Different people play different roles at different points in the DS career stages. Choosing the initial one is the most vital one. If you make any mistake at this stage, your entire career may get ruined.

My personal experience has led me to the realisation that it's always better to go with expert guidance regarding this most sensitive stage.

Hence, going out of the box, I suggest everyone have data science career counselling (only the professional ones).

Institutes like Learnbay offer extremely personalised and unbiased data science career counselling (free).

Such counselling sessions offer you the following benefits:-

 * Assess your individual ability to learn data science.
 * Identify the right path of mastering both statistical programming and analytical skills.

On top of that you have 1000s of folks who train, study online and make a career switch to data science.

But I'd argue that over 90% struggle with understanding, interpretation and ability to practically do something useful with the “data” they use.

Many “data scientists” who apply for a role feel there is a lot of competition. There isn't. Most can do the work but come up with ridiculous findings, backing this up by simple curve fitting that serves their purpose.

What is a data scientist's career path?,"Do you aspire to be a data scientist or just want to learn more about this fascinating field?

If that's the case, you've come to the correct place. To put it another way, gaining data science skills and pursuing a career in it, can help you transform your career.

But the most important question is: how can I get a Data Science job? What is the path to a successful career?

You don't have to be concerned. I am here to assist you in gaining these insights in the best possible way!

So, who exactly is a data scientist?

Trend identifiers, Mathematicians, and computer engineers make up data scientists. The data scientist's job is to decode massive amounts of data and perform additional analysis to uncover trends and obtain a better understanding of what it entails.

A data scientist is responsible for managing and handling data in almost every sector. This has certainly raised the demands of data professionals worldwide. Therefore, a career in this field is considered highly rewarding and can help in earning a smart salary.

How data science is incorporated into our day-to-day life?

Let's take a closer look at a common scenario with a data scientist:

# Perhaps even a cell phone provider wants to know which of its present clients would be most likely to move to a competitor's service.

# Customers who utilize a specific network bandwidth are more likely to quit, or consumers who are wedded and aged between 35 and 45 are perhaps the most likely to change carriers, according to that data analyst (or scientist).

# Every time a Netflix user logs in, they are seeing a real-life example of data processing in action. The video streaming platform features a program that will provide recommendations based on your preferences.

Some necessary skills that will help you excel as a data scientist

 * Learn how to use tools like MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and Teradata to gather and process data in databases.
 * Learn how to use probability, statistics, and applied mathematics to solve problems.
 * Improve your capacity to visualize outcomes. Data visualization is the process of combining different data types and visualizing the findings using diagrams, charts, and graphs.
What projects you can pick while learning Data Science?

Since you already know that data scientists work on their own, and they are also involved in both individual and group initiatives. Thus, hands-on projects improve skill levels, which is a vital component of career advancement.

So, below I have mentioned some of the famous DS projects that you may learn about:

 * 
 * Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
 * Breast Cancer Detection Project

So, how can you gain the basics as well as project-related knowledge?

Data Science learning necessities expert guidance and support. Thus, online data science courses can help you out with this. There are various platforms that are registered online and are providing top-notch DS courses right from the comfort of your home.

Therefore, I have compiled a list of some of the eminent data science courses that you might take up:

From asking the proper questions to developing inferences and reporting results, Coursera's specialization course addresses the tools and concepts you'll need throughout the data science pipeline. However, the cost of this course is a bit high and many people won't find it suitable.

Simplilearn is recognized among the best DS courses offered to students. This IBM-sponsored Data Scientist course includes unique IBM hackathons, masterclasses, and Ask-Me-Anything sessions. However, working professionals may not find this course suitable.

In my view, this institute is offering one of the best DS courses to learners. Their courses are curated to suit the needs of working professionals as well.

For a better understanding, let me introduce you to the course features:

 * The domain specialization is the most unique feature of Advanced Data Science and AI Program. They provide specialization in a plethora of domains such as IoT, Automotive, BFSI, HR, Healthcare, Banking and Finance, Marketing, etc. Domain-specific training can be used to complete capstone projects in data science. People will so benefit greatly academically and be able to become specialists much more quickly.
Advanced Data Science and AI Program

 * 
 * 7 Months Weekday
 * 9 Months Weekend
 * 250+ Hours of training

 * Classes are equipped with live sessions and one-on-one mentoring. For students that favor a practical approach to their academic studies, a hybrid learning environment blends conventional classroom instruction with online academic courses and real-world projects.
 * It also gives a golden opportunity to work on some of the best real-world as well as capstone projects. Experience in these projects will surely increase your chances of getting hired by the top MNCs. To complement their practical learning, students in the Advance Data Science and AI Program are given 12 real-world projects and two capstone projects.
 * The IBM Group has authorized all courses. Advanced Data Science and AI Program grants students three credentials. IBM provides certifications upon completion of courses, projects, and micro skills.
 * Utilize Project Innovation Lab's live, interactive learning from the comfort of your own home. Experts from MNCs and MAANG assist online and offline project sessions in at least seven Indian cities, including Delhi, Pune, and others, where several project innovation centers are located.
On a concluding note, I would like to draw your attention to the data science course in Bangalore offered by Learnbay as it is the best for working professionals. However, freshers may look for other alternatives available.

Thank you and all the best.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-data-scientists-career-path-1?top_ans=1477743648373015,2023-03-07T09:58:56.701924+00:00,,239,Kumar S,https://www.quora.com/profile/Kumar-S-1521
Is data scientist a good career path for freshers?,"You need a strong foundation in math, statistics, and programming. You can study domains from other fields. This forms the substantive expertise, but you still need to acquire the methods and core skill set. These apply modeling, analysis, programming, and evaluation in the math related subjects. You can achieve this with a major in a mathematical discipline. Any related fields gives you material from the domain. It is in analogy to a business, the material you work with during your job. You need to understand the business, organization, and particular product and services assigned to you. In the same way, you study the science, methods, history, literature, or topics in the other domain.

A data scientist has a new professional position, and some research positions. The market has accepted this position in their companies, but they might not have developed the team, systems, and positions in the company to facilitate an easy application. This means that compared to longer standing positions at a company, such as business units, technical staff, or primary producers and service people, a data scientist has a new role. You then have uncertainty to your studies, though a study in a mathematical subject though not directly applicable to the job at a company, serves the most conservative and reliable study. Any applied subjects such as statistics, applied math, or computer science provide you a body of learning, and the core skill set to stand out in applications.

You need to study the quality of life, public opinion on the job, company expectations for work, and the academics and experiences required to make a successful application. This balances out issues with your family life, friends and relationships, and lifestyle alongside a professional attitude. Your career probably stands high among your list of goals and achievements. This remains true for the larger part of a career at any company. But the career though interesting as its own work, also serves ends. It serves as a financial income, insurance stability, professional relationships, applying your academic studies, serving at a company with an interesting purpose, contributing to society, or doing the work you like.

In this sense, you need a higher analytical study of the offered academic curriculum, professional positions now open, companies that hire data scientists, who works with data scientists, the applications of the work of a data scientist, and many more interrelations that encourage you to invest your work. This crucially stands on a general theme for any professional commitment and endeavor. You treat it like an investment, with some risk for failure, stability, or compounded success. How you decide your time to study, work, and plan long term effects all your time - past, present, to future. You need to continually balance decisions to make the best decisions for your lifetime, and achieve goals. This means that how you identify goals also takes highest precedence, as it balances out the major factors. I have offered some considerations in lifestyle, academic interest, professional interest, finances, or personal relationships. These all factor into the decision to commit life and time, to make a career, which really only positions how you will live.

I recommend data science as a viable field, upcoming and still undergoing investment. Several academic departments with longer history, curriculum, professors, students, and applications have come about. They can see the usefulness of data science both academically and professionally. This issue ties closer to data science as a discipline at any institution, but still factors into a smaller career decision. You should want to know if the discipline will continue to grow, thrive, and provide high return on investment in the future. The answer to this question is yes, because data science has both a research direction, professional application, and utility for people in general. Most companies understand the analytical value, intellectual rigor, professional pragmatism, and contribution back to people simply making their living. It provides a solution to a pain point with data, analysis, management, computers and networks, and a professional attitude at companies.",https://www.quora.com/Is-data-scientist-a-good-career-path-for-freshers?top_ans=49524780,2017-07-05T16:13:20.793878+00:00,,4,Gilbert Doan,https://www.quora.com/profile/Gilbert-Doan

Which of the career option is better full stack developer or data scientist?,"Full-stack developers are adept at front-end, back-end, and other domains. Full-stack development is a fantastic job choice since specialists can monitor and control product development problems. In addition, Data science is also a great career with room for growth. LinkedIn calls Data Scientist ""the most promising career"" while Glassdoor calls it ""the top job in America"".

So, Data scientist or full-stack developer, which one is better for your career?

Full stack developers outperform data scientists in terms of skill sets like:

1. Knowledge of Programming
Full-stack developers have greater experience with programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby on Rails, etc.

2. Sharing knowledge

There are no extensive documentation processes in a full stack developer's team since everyone understands everything about coding, including designers and other non-technical individuals.

3. Being able to make sound judgments

This means that full-stack developers are more self-reliant; they are able to solve issues on their own, and they have a greater understanding of the code.

Both of these professions are critical in today's world of software development. A person should select a job path that they are more enthusiastic about, even if it is impossible to define which of the two is superior (Full stack developer vs Data scientist). Whereas, Full-stack developers are responsible for all aspects of software development, including database and server maintenance, data collecting and processing, and more.

Now that you know that both careers are very rewarding but Full-stack web development has more scope, let's compare the job roles as well. Because that is what everything comes down to. Your skills and interests.

Full stack developer job role

 * Developing and designing software.
 * Clean front and back-end code.
 * Web app user interactions.
Data Scientist job role

 * Turning organized and unstructured data into usable information.
 * Identifying the most promising data-analytics solutions.
 * Promotes data-driven business solutions.
 * Cleansing and validating data improves quality and accuracy.
If either of these jobs interests you, there are various opportunities to take a course in these fields and get into the industry. There are numerous institutes that offer data science courses as well as full-stack developer courses. You are free to select the option that is most suitable for you, but if I were in your position, I would encourage you to enroll in a Full-Stack Web Developer course because of the many opportunities available in this industry.

I’ll list a few popular institutes for reference below for the same:

ExcelRis plagued by a plethora of issues. It does not suggest that you must begin swimming in the ocean until you have spent years practising. This institute contains a wide range of data structures and algorithm problems. Simply concentrate on two aspects that will assist you in your preparation. They are also famous for the data science courses they provide. They are primarily known for them. However, this institute does not offer any job assistance which is the main disadvantage.

It offers the best data science courses in Bangalore, which can be accessed from anywhere. They offer various courses in data science as well as full stack development. But, there is no better place to learn full-stack development, which has a campus right here in Bangalore. Numerous exercises are included in the Full-Stack Development Program. There are hundreds of data structure and algorithm problems to solve in their web programming curriculum, and well-known professors are on hand to help you.

They have a full stack development program as well:

 * They offer instruction that is specifically geared at learning about a given area in-depth. Web 3.0, web development, project management, and devops & clouds are among the available domains.
 * They provide IBM course completion certificates.
They have few Data Science programs as well. They are as follows:

 * Advance Data Science and AI Program
 * Data Science and AI for Managers and Leaders
Their courses have very unique features structured to advance your career. Their features are as follows:

 * Their courses offer real-time and capstone projects that will help you with building industry experience, updating your resume, and polishing your skills. Some of them are phone directory applications using doubly-linked lists, Graph-based projects on data structures, Stack-based text editors, and so on.
 * The Program has been authorised by IBM, the most recognized business in the world, to offer certifications. IBM will award you a certificate of completion for both the course and the project after you have successfully completed both.
 * Although the Advance Data Science and AI Program may aid with your professional advancement, it's crucial to keep in mind your motivation for choosing this particular career path. Retail sales, e-commerce, the supply chain, and the manufacture of mechanical and communication equipment in the BFSI business are a few of the topics discussed.
 * There are facilities for project innovation in at least seven Indian cities, including Delhi, Pune, and other places, where professionals from MNCs and MAANG provide assistance for both online and in-person project sessions.
 * It also offers what is known as hybrid learning, an educational strategy that blends conventional classroom instruction with online coursework and practical exercises, for students who want a more hands-on approach to their academic efforts.
Final thoughts

Both full stack developer and data scientist careers are well rewarding with high salaries. The bottom line is to figure out where your interest lies. Once you’ve decided what you want to build your expertise in, join a good course with good job assistance.

I hope my answer helped you.

Is data scientist a good career path for freshers?,"Absolutely. Career opportunities for data scientists have been growing exponentially in recent years, driven by the fact that data has emerged as the new currency & competitive advantage really lies in drawing actionable insights from it. Companies are therefore keen to attract candidates who have the requisite skills to take on positions of Data Analysts, Scientists, Engineers and more. In fact, India is the second-largest country to recruit employees in the field of data science, second only to the United States. Entry-level data scientists earn around 5 lakh per annum & the salary increases exponentially as the years of experience increase. Importantly, the reliance on data is only going to increase as is the demand for trained personnel in the field. There is therefore no better time to start as a fresher in the field. The only aspect to work on is to equip yourself with the right skills. This would mean enrolling in a course that keeps you ahead of industry trends and makes you job ready. In choosing the right course you need to look for aspects such as does it allow you to get your hands dirty with data by offering enough research opportunities, does it offer opportunities to allow you to interact with eminent data scientists in the field, does it have relevant industry accreditations & connects to offer robust placement.

How can I become a data scientist?,"I am working as a Data Scientist myself therefore it makes me qualified enough to answer your question.

Also I will make sure to include the tricks in my answer that worked for me.

So Let's begin, Shall we?

I will be answering this question, keeping in mind that a bunch of readers could be complete newbies into programming.

So addressing non-computer science students. Firstly, you need to work a lot on your problem-solving skills which is going to help you code effortlessly. You can achieve this by learning Data structures & Algorithms and coding in it. Also, DS & Algo are the building block of computer science so it will definitely help you on your Journey towards excellence in coding.

After you are comfortable with problem-solving, you should stick to the below mentioned points:

1. Opt for a good course on Machine learning and study it thoroughly to become well versed with all it’s concepts.
2. Practice machine learning problems on Kaggle: Your Machine Learning and Data Science Community [ https://www.kaggle.com/ ] which will help you gain confidence and give you enough hands-on skills.
3. Post your projects on GitHub, LinkedIn and also you can use youtube to showcase your skills
4. Now it’s Time to market yourself. Make a clean and creative online portfolio and a strong resume based on ML. Start applying to your desired companies and surely circumstances will bend in your favour and soon you will become something you have worked so hard for and that is “Data scientist”
5. you can connect with me on LinkedIn

"Can I get job as a data scientist, being a fresh graduate?","Yes - but the chances of getting a job are around 10% based on my research of 100+ job openings.

First of all, understand the skill requirements needed for a data scientist. I have summarized this in one image below.

If a fresher has these skills and has demonstrated these skills in their project portfolio, they will have much better chances.

On the other hand, if a fresher has these qualifications more likely they will get thru even easily.

 * Statistics background / Quantitative background / Engineering - Computer science and related fields like Operations Research
 * Are from premier institutes like IIT/IIM/NIT (Indian Top Institutes)
If you are a fresher, I would suggest you get into Data Scientist job thru two routes

 * first, join as a data analyst, get 2–3 years of experience. then switch to data scientist position after getting above skills
 * join as a data engineer, get 2–3 years of experience, and then get into data scientist position.
I have friends who have taken both these routes.

A shortcut may be to get good at hackathons and win a hackathon. I know a person who won a hackathon and is now employed as a Data Scientist in an electronics company.

How can I know if data science is for me?,"I was just going through an old notebook from grad school, and found this assignment from my regression analysis course.

This is how I knew that “data science was for me”:

1. I thoroughly enjoyed doing these types of assignments. Unlike some mathematics courses, the statistics problems were ones that I felt genuinely confident in deriving solutions to.
2. The practical interpretation portions were something that just “clicked” for me. In other words, I read the output in terms of the problem, not in terms of the “model”.
3. I knew I wanted to work full-time on problems like the above (though less defined) before I ever heard the words “data” and “science” used side-by-side. I was lucky to get experience doing just this in my university’s research lab, validating this interest.
4. Out of every class I’ve taken, whether it be undergrad, graduate school, certifications & trainings, or even the occasional MOOC, this course continues to take the cake.
Ultimately, the only way to know if “data science is for you” is to forget about the sexy title, and decide whether or not you genuinely enjoy the work.

There’s a lot of debate out there on what constitutes someone being a “data scientist”. Forget about the debate.

Find a few job postings, read the descriptions, and recall a time when you’ve done something similar. Did you enjoy it?

If not, then data science isn’t for you.

If you’ve never done anything like it then it’s probably a sign that you need to explore more.

If you’ve done something similar and loved it then it’s probably for you.

"Which of these careers is less stressful: Data scientist, Data engineer or software engineer? Why?","Ultimately it depends on the organization, but I would rank them by stress as follows, most to least:

 * Data Scientist
 * Data Engineer
 * Software Engineer
I’ll start with why I see Data Scientist as often the most stressful, then move onto data engineer and software engineer.

“Data Scientist” is currently an ill-defined title, meaning there a lot of misconceptions around what the role requires. Also, data science is highly experimental, which runs counter to how organizations like to manage risk and measure/track work. These issues can lead to stress and a high burnout rate among Data Scientists; something discussed at length in several articles (see references at end).

Here are some consequences:

 * hiring managers bring in a Data Scientist to work on tasks ill-suited for the role;
 * organizations have unrealistic expectations about what Machine Learning can do for them and their products;
 * there are severe disconnects between what a data scientist produces and what product managers expect;
 * friction occurs at the intersection of experimental work like machine learning and well-defined, rules-based work like software engineering;
 * data scientists end up working in isolation.
If you are working on tasks you don’t enjoy every day this will inevitably lead to stress. Countless data scientists in industry complain about being tasked with building reports and writing SQL, with little to no work in machine learning. Nobody becomes a data scientist to write SQL and build reports. This comes from an organization misconstruing data science with business intelligence/analytics.

Sometimes an organization does understand the proper role of data scientist. But then we often run into the unrealistic expectations scenario. AI is hyped beyond reason at this point, meaning companies tend to assume a Data Scientist will swoop in and magically convert their data into money-making predictions. The reality is no company has all the right data, and it takes a massive effort in experimentation to convert raw data into something that can live inside a real product and drive value, both of which have no guarantee of happening. There’s little “sexy” about this profession.

Then there’s the “PM issue.” Product managers are taught to manage traditional software projects. All their methodologies around ideation, story writing, estimation, acceptance criteria, and measuring/tracking progress grew out of managing rules-based engineering projects. Software engineers do explicitly defined tasks which produce exact outcomes. These outcomes can be tracked, measured, tested and of course discussed easily at “standup.” Data science isn’t rules-based, it requires messy exploration with unknown outcomes. Unless a PM learns how to manage projects that include data science the experience will be far less than ideal.

By the time the Data Engineer is ready to implement machine learning into the data pipeline the model has likely been validated at the proof-of-concept level, meaning there is much less uncertainty around whether machine learning can drive value. Data engineering is much more well-defined than Data Science since it is effectively rules-based engineering applied to machine learning. Specifically, data engineers help create the scaffolding that holds machine learning in place. But, I see this role as more stressful than software developer since the rules-based scaffolding must somehow mix deterministic with nondeterministic outputs. For example, while the software developer is tasked with unit testing explicit outputs, the data engineer must test for outputs that change when new data are ingested. This involves the use of thresholds and ranges, along with extensive monitoring of context drift and model performance.

Finally, Software Engineers deal with traditional, rules-based programming. This is the technology that companies think of when we speak of software. There are much fewer unrealistic expectations, program managers are trained to manage this kind of work, and software developers are the most numerous technical position in the company meaning less isolation and the ability to share workloads.

As stated from the beginning, all this depends on the organization. Some companies have developed an appreciation for how different data science is from traditional, rules-based software development, and have taken steps to merge these disciplines into an effective practice. Data scientists working for these companies are likely much less stressed.

%3E Ask the interview candidate about how much time he thinks that will be spent on data modeling.

If he answers more than 20%. Don’t hire.
The fun part is that the post is telling us pretty much the truth.

It’s true that some outliers are working on highly-specialized AI positions at IBM/Facebook/Google research departments, but in the end, for the mortals, its an accurate interview scenario.

Data Scientist main characteristics

When I say main characteristics I need to be clear that we have an assumption that a Data Scientist is already good with math, statistics and computing plus a cherry on the cake, at least one year of experience in some market niche (domain knowledge).

Data Scientists ARE NOT plug and play. You can just unplug a Data Scientist from a cancer research program and plug into a stock market consulting role.

So with all said. That's the basics, that you see everywhere. No need do discuss or reinvent the wheel.

Data Scientists need to convince people of the importance, usefulness and accuracy of their work. Most of posts don’t mention that. Let's think in hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the persuasion need:

1. You show the output of a black-box neural network with maximum precision and recall. Apparently blindly ignoring your numbers, investors don't believe in the results and start an endless Q&A session. They say that they will invest millions of dollars on the idea only after a clear understanding of assumptions and a successful experiment…and so on.
2. Try to explain what is a moving average to a salesperson? They are supposed to know the difference between median, mean an mode, right? Or some basic thing like quartiles and a tricky question about bagplots. Probably by now, you noticed that there is a inherent evangelism role for every data science position. Tools are only good if people are using them. You can provide a set of outputs, predictions and reports, but they are useless if people don't understand or use. Adoption, adoptio…adoption!
3. You schedule a Friday meeting to transfer knowledge from Data Science to other departments like sales, marketing, maintenance and accounting. You have a naive goal to explain and teach what is a Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Taylor series, Laplace transforms. Near the end of the meeting, when you realize, people will be dead or in a coma. They were killed by boringness. Data is a bunch of fun only for data guys, remember it. A more successful approach would be to teach integrals by referring to them as the area below the curve. Geometry instead of algebric, Socrates! Visual communication instead of just words or equations.
So let’s face it. We (analytical people) speak a different language and it needs to be translated into the world’s lingua franca. Otherwise, no one will listen, or even worse, they will pretend to listen and understand.

By now you are supposed to be convinced that one of the most important characteristics of a Data Scientist is “evangelism”, “sell your fish”. Not everyone can abandon “gut feelings” and be “data-driven” by themselves.

There is another characteristics related do evangelism present in most of the well-know and seasoned Data Scientists. They can communicate very complex concepts in a way that people will understand (or maybe get a grasp of the actual meaning).

Old versus new

You can be lucky to start working in a new company with all that fresh mentality of Business Intelligence, KPIs, predictive and prescriptive analytics, real-time dashboards, data access to everyone and the AI term being used every where (when actually is just machine learning. I forgive you, marketing department!).

Or…
You can start to work for a +100 years law company where your main job will be to convince others that your work is valuable and it’s not just another “hype/trend” being followed by a managerial decision.

The dream of every company, the central data repository of truth and a data-driven mindset can only be achieved with everyone embracing this long-term mission. A Data Scientist, can be the facilitator, a virus (in a good sense), but the virus needs to proliferate (create allies) in order to facilitate “fever” to shake down things.

Domain Expertise/Knowledge

There was a competition for improving the Paypal fraud detection. In the middle of all the Kaggle obsession with algorithms, the company responsible for developing the winning solution was very clear. They didn’t use any fancy algorithm or a deep neural network with thousands of hidden layers. They only used their past acquired experience of 10 years working with fraudulent transactions.

It’s really important to understand this concept. People think in Data Scientists as the “joker”card, a wildcard character. It's true that some abilities that rely on programming, logic thinking and math/stats are portable to different industries. However, the domain expertise is highly related to the industry that the Data Scientist has more familiarity and years of work.


%3E This is not supposed to be a new concept, right? It’s been that way for all the history of humankind, for all professionals.
The problem is that some people took the “generalization” of certain intelligent models too seriously, as granted. Then, they applied to everything and everyone without restrictions.

A Data Scientist with 5 years experience with banking will be totally different from one that spent one decade researching cancer. Different technology stacks (R or Python) and/or different approaches for similar problems. They can be interchangeable, but the learning curve is significant and painful. This needs to be take into account (special attention for HR recruiters reading this paragraph).

Data Science is all about controversy

I don’t personally like these two answers below, but I think that it’s good to read them to hear different opinions about Data Scientists.

 * Michael Hochster [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Hochster ]'s anwser about Data Scientists, basically defines two types. Type A (Analysis) and Type B (Build) Data Scientists.
I disagree with that statement. When I say disagree, I mean REALLY disagree. The main reason it’s that the definition is too simplistic. The data market will not evolve with terms like type B or type A.


%3E “Hey, I’ve just landed a job position as Data Scientist Type B at the TypeC Company”.
This is well aligned to the trend of IT industry of calling people by uninspired terms liks “architect” or “engineer”. You can be a “software engineer or a database architect”, but if you have a computer science bachelors you are a “computer scientist”, not the single-word term “engineer”. I'm a mechanical engineer, thus an engineer. Same thing for architects. They are…architects, simple as stated, architects.

Yes, it’s good to discuss about these picky things for us to not lose control.

Another idea that I disagree but its good to understand is the conception from Ingo Mierswa [ https://rapidminer.com/author/ingo/ ]: Founder & President of RapidMiner.


%3E Data scientists are people who apply all those analytical techniques and the necessary data preparation in the context of a business application.
Let’s go back to the case of an independent Data Scientist researcher fighting big corporations, mining data and trying to extract patterns that will help to cure cancer. I certainly think that it's not on the context of “business applications”.

Does a Data Scientist develop products or product features?

Another great missconception. I really liked my summer internship at Cognitive Class  [ https://cognitiveclass.ai/ ](IBM Canada), because we were not developing products. We were developing courses and exploring algorithms and data.

Yes, you can improve the gamified leaderboard of an app. No problem with that, but we can’t confine Data Scientists to work only with products.

As of today, I founded a consultancy company that have Data Scientist working with consulting and products.

The result of a Data Scientist analysis can affect a business decision, can motivate someone to change his/her career (like some of my posts and based on the private feedback that I'm receiving), endorse a hiring budget and many other possibilities. It doesn’t need to be a product, it can be a service to external and/or internal clients!

Does A Data Scientist works near business, money flow, “plata”?


%3E “It's All About the Money, Honey! ”
Okay, now you want to talk about business.

Data Scientists working on Bussiness Intelligence, Strategy Consulting, banking and finance can have high-paying careers. The downside is that we can’t take only these profiles into account to define a whole group of professionals.

Let’s get some data if we're talking about money:

Ref.: Oreilly 2016 data science salary survey [ http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/2016-data-science-salary-survey.pdf ]

Sometimes I can get astonishined by seing how the Central limit theorem  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem ]really works for when you have a large  [ https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/269/what-is-the-difference-between-a-population-and-a-sample ]sample of your population.
The survey looks approximately as a “Bell Curve” (aka Normal distribution [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution ]) with the mean around 100k ~120k US Dollars.

A lot of money!

We are getting closer on this post to find out why some companies are willing to pay that much for Data Scientists (if you are not convinced yet, remember, this is just the AVERAGE)

Definitions

it’s not only one, you are dealing with Data Science [ https://www.quora.com/What-is-data-science/answer/Luis-Martins-200 ]. Your eyes need to bleed for things start making sense.

After this long post, I’ll share my proposal that is more aligned with what I’ve seen around my feed and what, at the same time, makes more sense (at least for me):

Data Engineer

 * Extract, transform and loads data from all types of sources
 * Maintain pipelines and databases (Some overlap with a DBA [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_administrator ])
 * Interface between back-end/database team and Data Scientists team
Machine Learning Practitioner/Specialist/Engineer

 * Data Modeling. If the company is large enough, works only developing models;
 * Create containers to make the models “production ready”;
 * Test, Learn and deploy new algorithms (
 * 
 * There is a lot of algorithms to learn, believe me, just Artificial Neural Networks would take all the 71.5 years of average life expectancy for a human being to be properly learned;

 * Optimization
Data Analyst/Business Analyst

 * Can be related to business, but not necessarily;
 * Can consume data from the models generated by the Machine Learning Practitioner or straight from data pipelines developed by Data Engineers;
 * Share insights with plain english.
Mathematicians and statisticians

 * Do everything that a Machine Learning Practitioner does but without all the glamour and hype;
 * Propose experiments to prove or reprove hypothesis (e.g. A/B Testing).
Data Scientist (The unicorn, The Asymptote [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote ], The GOAL!)

 * + 10 years of experience
 * Needs to have experience and proven knowledge in all the roles above and be capable of temporarily acting as one of the described positions, if in need. Doesn't mean that should;
 * The glue that put’s everything together;
 * Direct report to upper management level (if in a business context);
 * Domain expertise focus
Okay, One last chance for those of you that missed the Integral and differential Calculus [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus ] class.

I like to think in the following way to don’t get too depressed while facing what a Data Scientist could know. To stay with sanity, I focus on what I should know and work to get better on that.

Ref.: my Wacom

According to my own theory (US Patent pending), the Data Scientist Goal is an Red Dashed Asymptote, something that these blue and green lines will never achieve or get to know what is like.

… Blue curve is a data professional working and studying 14hrs/day
… Green curve is a data professional working and studying 8hrs/day

The only difference is the rate that they learn and evolve. The sad part is that both will not reach the Data Scientist Goal.

This approach is similar to:


%3E “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” - Norman Vincent Peale, author of The Power of Positive Thinking.
After 1x Human life we start to see the prediction of the blue line. To give the blue one a chance, let’s suppose that this poor data professional is actually immortal!

Then, surprisingly, we'll have the dashed blue lines (projection) that still won’t touch the Data Scientist Goal due to the mathematical nature of asymptotes. Theoretically, in the end of its immortality, this blue data professional would be a complete and up to date Data Scientist unicorn .

I hope that this post familiarize you with lots of technical terms that you will face along the way if you are pursuing a data science career, planning to hire someone or invest in Data Science.

Ps.: asymptotes are not supposed to be new for you if you are planning to pursue an analytical career.

Conclusion

After all, that’s why I have the Jr. Data Scientist title on my Linkedin [ https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisotsm/ ] profile. It’s something that reminds constantly my ego that we don’t know anything, we don’t have a clue of what is about to happen next and the only certainty is that we need to learn more.

"Is working as a data scientist that much more interesting than a regular software engineer? If not, why is there so much hype?","DATA SCIENCE FTW (for deeply personal reasons)

Having done work as a “regular software engineer” and a “data scientist”, both at Amazon, I can definitively say that being a data scientist is far more interesting to me.

This is not to say that it’s inherently more interesting – it’s solely a predisposition I have towards wrangling big sets of data, doing statistics, and writing ML models. There are many people who find software engineering far more interesting than data science.

Software engineering is much more building-centric than data science is. You start out with a grand vision for what you want something to be, and then you go to work laying out the bricks and the beams to make that thing become a reality.

Some people adore the building, the creating.

Some people enjoy solving complex problems using cool math and novel computer science techniques. You start out with a question or a problem, and then deduce the answer using scientific reasoning.

Some people adore the experimenting, the discovering.

"Which career is more promising: data scientist or software developer? Which is better in terms of salary and long term growth, and why?","It is always a Data Scientist!

Most of the leading companies of this decade, such as Apple, Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb, sell digital products to millions of customers in thousands of locations. The two pillars of 21st-century companies are data and software. Demand for software engineers and data scientists is high.

These products require software that is functional, intuitive, and bug-free. Data that informs the experience of these products must be stored, analysed, and interpreted efficiently. Software engineers and data scientists will play crucial roles in shaping the world in 2020 and beyond.

Who earns more: software engineers or data scientists? These careers and their related fields are lucrative and pay above-average salaries. A bachelor's degree or master's degree is no longer required for these career paths. US News' 100 Best Jobs list places software developers at the top, while data science is among the top 15 fastest-growing jobs in the country. Both are excellent options.

How does a Software Engineer Do?

Programming is a part of software engineering that includes coding (or programming) to foster programming to resolve explicit issues or needs of clients. Computer programmers (coders/software engineers/designers) construct these arrangements utilising programming dialects like Java, JavaScript, C++, Scala, Swift, Kotlin, etc.

Concentrates on a show that the interest for programmers is relied upon to increment before long.

How do data Scientists Do?

DS is the field of gathering, putting away, coordinating, examining, and deciphering enormous informational indexes. A Data Scientist is one who uses an association's information to assist pioneers with settling on informed choices in light of data analysis and measurable investigation. Data Scientists may likewise apply AI and man-made consciousness procedures, just as information mining, to fabricate prescient models.

Data Scientists are popular for all intents and purposes in each industry, from monetary administrations to food conveyance.

Is Data Science Harder Than Software Engineering?

DS and programming are both innovative occupations, however, they generally require various abilities. Every job carries with it mechanical intricacies and genuine business issues. Also, every one of these fields utilises various devices, methods, and cycles to address them. Programming may be more appropriate for somebody who functions admirably inside designs and lean towards having rules and cycles to observe. DS may be better for somebody who prospers in turmoil, tracking down bits of knowledge in unstructured information.

Both programming and DS include programming somewhat. The essential contrast between the two is the end result.


%3E For programmers, the eventual outcome is programming applications and frameworks for any stage.

%3E For Data Scientists, the eventual outcome is bits of knowledge factual models, prescient calculations, representations, or reports
It is basic to note here that while Data Scientists additionally use programming to play out their capacities, they don't fabricate these product items or information design; there are computer programmers devoted to building programming answers for huge amounts of information called information engineers.

Who Earns More: Software Engineers or Data Scientists?

A profoundly experienced programmer procures $178,000 by and large, while a Data Scientist with tantamount experience and abilities acquires $155,000. (Source: Robert Half's Salary Guide.)

A comparative distinction is seen across experience and expertise levels. Be that as it may, any expert's compensation is a component of a few variables. How about we check them individually and comprehend the holes.

Pay rates by area

Payscale shows that programmers in the San Francisco Bay Area have a compensation scope of up to 40% higher than the public normal, demonstrating that Silicon Valley is as yet the fantasy objective for programmers. This is valid for Data Scientists too, however, the distinction from the public normal is marginally lower at 27%.

Seattle comes a close second for the two jobs, offering more significant compensations than the remainder of the country. With tech monsters like Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook's designing groups working out of Seattle, this shocks no one.

Compensations by top businesses

 * Probably the best tech organisations offer serious pay rates to draw in talented computer programmers just as Data Scientists.
 * Amazon and Facebook seem to pay top programmer compensations - $150,000 overall. Uber, Bloomberg, and LinkedIn approach at $140,000.
 * For Data Scientists, Apple and Facebook by and by top the rundown, firmly followed by Uber, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
Would Software Engineer be able to Become a Data Scientist?

Both being connected with innovation occupations and related fields, this progress is absolutely conceivable. On the off chance that you're a computer programmer hoping to progress, centre around creating abilities in maths, insights, information fighting, AI, information mining, information perception, and different DS abilities, either through self-learning or an internet-based course or Bootcamp. Assuming that you as of now have abilities in a programming language like Python or R, broadly utilised in DS, you're good to go.

Computer programming and DS are both exceptionally sought-after innovation occupations. Considering the amount of programming advancement today includes parts of DS, the two gatherings of experts work in equal, across comparable levels of the authoritative construction. As a rule, the distinction in pay rates for the two jobs is immaterial.

But then if you want to become a Data Scientist then the journey is so easy as a software developer.

To become a software developer all you need is the knowledge of a few programming languages and knowledge of a few frameworks and any company would hire you as a software developer after that they might give you training and then you are ready to serve the software world.

But on the other hand, if you wish to become a data scientist then you have to do a lot of hard work. Becoming a data scientist is not easy. Dealing with statistics and algorithms is a way more complex process than learning computer programming languages.

So you need expert help to become a data scientist and for a promising career.

Various expert courses for Data science aspirants are there on the web. Some of the best courses are from Simplilearn, Coursera, Learnbay, UpGrad, etc.

If you are a complete fresher with zero knowledge about the corporate world then you should join Simplilearn, Coursera, UpGrad, etc. But, if you are a working professional then you should join institutions like Learnbay.

Learnbay comes with excellent features like Domain specialisation, flexible years of subscription, live-one-to-one classes, LMS support, career guidance, job referrals, etc.

Domain Specialisation would allow you to learn Data Science even if you are in some other domain. And very few institutions provide features like domain specialisation.

So you can book free career counseling with Learnbay experts and can make the best out of it. They also provide offline classes for a Data Science course in Bangalore, Delhi, Chennai, and Gurgaon(hybrid).

Apart from these, you should do some research with other institutes before coming to the final conclusion.

Is a Data Analyst a good Data Scientist career start?,"I don’t think it would hurt in the least. To be clear, I do data mining and my job title is Data Analyst. I am a grad student in a Data Science program. While the bare minimum requirement for being a Data Analyst is SQL and Excel, there are opportunities to stretch the position and responsibilities for all they are worth. For instance, if you can get IT permissions to install Python or R (python runs in the user space so you technically don’t need admin rights but may not be worth the risk of possibly getting fired), then you can start to develop a lot of data science skills, at least foundational ones, which are critical if you are in the self-taught crowd.

 * Start with all of your repetitive tasks, automate them with your scripting language of choice. Maybe you have to run a SQL query, transform the data, save a summary table in an Excel file, and email it to someone. Easily done in your preferred scripting language.
 * Learn to do all your data visualization in in Python or R. This is great because there are no training wheels here like on an MOOC. It all depends on you to develop this skill.
 * With your newly acquired free time at work thanks to your task automation, find an interesting problem to solve that may be similar to something you’ve done on Kaggle. If you aren’t that far along in your data science journey, there’s a ton of opportunity for exploratory data analysis with your company’s data.
 * Take the time to learn how the various applications in use at your company work. Appreciate the inner workings and how small tweaks may provide large impacts, or how limitations of the application might impact your company’s business.
 * Take the time to learn the domain. Be patient and think critically. This point can tie in with the above point. Learn how to reach out for help and to ask good questions.
All the while, continue your data science education outside of work. You will still need data science projects, probably a github repo, a kaggle presence, etc. But you will also have professional experience dealing with data. You will also demonstrate that you go above and beyond the base requirements of your job. If given the opportunity, and you are in the self-taught crowd, I think working as a Data Analyst would go a long way to help land that first DS role.",https://www.quora.com/Is-data-scientist-a-good-career-path-for-freshers?top_ans=98011241,2018-09-03T18:07:33.169137+00:00,,22,Tad Peterson,https://www.quora.com/profile/Tad-Peterson-2

Is doing a data scientist job harder than a regular software developer’s job on a regular basis?,"I’m always wary of claiming that one job is harder than another. Different jobs can be hard in totally different ways.

 * Unlike a steel worker, a data scientist doesn’t have to do hard physical work.
 * Unlike an investment banker, a data scientist doesn’t need to work long hours.
 * Unlike a teacher, a data scientist doesn’t have to deal with children.
 * Unlike a middle manager, a data scientist doesn’t have to deal with adults that behave like children.
 * Unlike a paramedic, a data scientist doesn’t have to deal with the emotional effects of seeing people die.
Data science is not stressful or physically challenging. It can be hard because you encounter complex intellectual challenges. In that sense, it’s very similar to software development.

How intellectually challenging are these jobs? Well, that mostly depends on the individual data scientist or software developer. It can be as hard as you make it. The complexity of the job is mainly constrained by your own imagination and creativity.

So I’d say they’re about equal. You sit calmly in an office and solve problems with code and data.

1. Make more than most doctors.
2. Work remotely 100% of the time.
3. Work with really smart people.
4. Not a lot of human interaction. Very few meetings.
5. A total package like C level execs. (Bonus, sick leave, paid time off)
6. For the most part, I make my own hours. I’m not a morning person so I block off my calendar so other’s can’t set up meetings at 8am. I’m still sleeping then and don’t want to be interrupted.
7. Tons of jobs. If I don’t like my job for any reason, I move on.
8. A career for life. At 50, I’ll never not have job in this space. Ever.
9. Highly respected. This career is one of the most technical and respected in all of IT.
Those are a few reasons that make machine learning a great career.

Now, don’t kid yourself. I’ve been working with data and BI for 20 years. You won’t be in a MLE role in a few months and not likely in a few years but I wouldn’t change a thing.

Try to become as well-rounded a software engineer as possible with an emphasis on web technologies. This is the field with the most jobs.

ML and data science is harder. There are fewer jobs around and it's harder to create value once you land a job. The requirements of ML solutions are less clear and it's harder to communicate the value you provide to stakeholders. You don't want to expose yourself to that unless you are really passionate about it.

Most successful ML engineers and data scientists, myself included, pursued this career because we were obsessed about machine learning. For me, getting a job as a data scientist was a side effect of geeking out with ML, not the other way around.

If you're a full-stack web developer, you're immediately useful to almost every company on earth. And it's easy to prove your worth. Start making things, and your stakeholders can see the results in their web browser right away.

Which of the career option is better full stack developer or data scientist?,"Full-stack developers are adept at front-end, back-end, and other domains. Full-stack development is a fantastic job choice since specialists can monitor and control product development problems. In addition, Data science is also a great career with room for growth. LinkedIn calls Data Scientist ""the most promising career"" while Glassdoor calls it ""the top job in America"".

So, Data scientist or full-stack developer, which one is better for your career?

Full stack developers outperform data scientists in terms of skill sets like:

1. Knowledge of Programming
Full-stack developers have greater experience with programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby on Rails, etc.

2. Sharing knowledge

There are no extensive documentation processes in a full stack developer's team since everyone understands everything about coding, including designers and other non-technical individuals.

3. Being able to make sound judgments

This means that full-stack developers are more self-reliant; they are able to solve issues on their own, and they have a greater understanding of the code.

Both of these professions are critical in today's world of software development. A person should select a job path that they are more enthusiastic about, even if it is impossible to define which of the two is superior (Full stack developer vs Data scientist). Whereas, Full-stack developers are responsible for all aspects of software development, including database and server maintenance, data collecting and processing, and more.

Now that you know that both careers are very rewarding but Full-stack web development has more scope, let's compare the job roles as well. Because that is what everything comes down to. Your skills and interests.

Full stack developer job role

 * Developing and designing software.
 * Clean front and back-end code.
 * Web app user interactions.
Data Scientist job role

 * Turning organized and unstructured data into usable information.
 * Identifying the most promising data-analytics solutions.
 * Promotes data-driven business solutions.
 * Cleansing and validating data improves quality and accuracy.
If either of these jobs interests you, there are various opportunities to take a course in these fields and get into the industry. There are numerous institutes that offer data science courses as well as full-stack developer courses. You are free to select the option that is most suitable for you, but if I were in your position, I would encourage you to enroll in a Full-Stack Web Developer course because of the many opportunities available in this industry.

I’ll list a few popular institutes for reference below for the same:

ExcelRis plagued by a plethora of issues. It does not suggest that you must begin swimming in the ocean until you have spent years practising. This institute contains a wide range of data structures and algorithm problems. Simply concentrate on two aspects that will assist you in your preparation. They are also famous for the data science courses they provide. They are primarily known for them. However, this institute does not offer any job assistance which is the main disadvantage.

It offers the best data science courses in Bangalore, which can be accessed from anywhere. They offer various courses in data science as well as full stack development. But, there is no better place to learn full-stack development, which has a campus right here in Bangalore. Numerous exercises are included in the Full-Stack Development Program. There are hundreds of data structure and algorithm problems to solve in their web programming curriculum, and well-known professors are on hand to help you.

They have a full stack development program as well:

 * They offer instruction that is specifically geared at learning about a given area in-depth. Web 3.0, web development, project management, and devops & clouds are among the available domains.
 * They provide IBM course completion certificates.
They have few Data Science programs as well. They are as follows:

 * Advance Data Science and AI Program
 * Data Science and AI for Managers and Leaders
Their courses have very unique features structured to advance your career. Their features are as follows:

 * Their courses offer real-time and capstone projects that will help you with building industry experience, updating your resume, and polishing your skills. Some of them are phone directory applications using doubly-linked lists, Graph-based projects on data structures, Stack-based text editors, and so on.
 * The Program has been authorised by IBM, the most recognized business in the world, to offer certifications. IBM will award you a certificate of completion for both the course and the project after you have successfully completed both.
 * Although the Advance Data Science and AI Program may aid with your professional advancement, it's crucial to keep in mind your motivation for choosing this particular career path. Retail sales, e-commerce, the supply chain, and the manufacture of mechanical and communication equipment in the BFSI business are a few of the topics discussed.
 * There are facilities for project innovation in at least seven Indian cities, including Delhi, Pune, and other places, where professionals from MNCs and MAANG provide assistance for both online and in-person project sessions.
 * It also offers what is known as hybrid learning, an educational strategy that blends conventional classroom instruction with online coursework and practical exercises, for students who want a more hands-on approach to their academic efforts.
Final thoughts

Both full stack developer and data scientist careers are well rewarding with high salaries. The bottom line is to figure out where your interest lies. Once you’ve decided what you want to build your expertise in, join a good course with good job assistance.

I hope my answer helped you.

Should I be a data scientist or software engineer?,"That's the dilemma of my life :)

I found that there are ways to combine the two. A data scientist doesn't have to work with data or build models all day long. One can also be building components that infer something from data, as a part of an automated software piece.

For example, if you're building a fitness tracking app that is in charge of counting steps, you have two major steps for developing the solution:

1. Algorithmic: taking some data you collected A priori and develop an algorithm that is capable of figuring out how many steps had been taken. This might include:

 * Researching the problem
 * Looking at the data and finding patterns
 * Data cleansing, feature engineering and processing of the data (fft etc.)
 * Developing the model
 * Evaluating the model's performance
2. Software Implementation: implement the algorithm:

 * Get the sensory data out of the sensors
 * Make sure the algorithm doesn't fail (exceptions and such)
 * Take care of different cases
 * Make sure the performance is acceptable
 * Send the output to the UI / other modules
So this task, which is essentially a ""data scientist"" task, has lots of challenges both from the data perspective and the software implementation perspective.

I'm sure there are many more examples like this one.

How do I choose between moving into data science or data engineering when I'm already a software engineer?,"Skills-wise, I’d say a software engineer is already part-data engineer. Many of the same languages, platforms, and tools used to build apps and systems are used for data infrastructure (in fact data infra is part of a typical app or software solution). Data science is closer to the user side of things - a software engineer needs to get affinity for statistics, research methods and algorithms.

However, skills notwithstanding I think your choice depends on what interests you more: searching for patterns and insights, or building things. Data science is about finding patterns from data. The role is part-detective part-mathematician. You use math to tease insight to solve a specific business or research question. Data engineering is about building data pipelines. The role is part-architect, part-carpenter. You use data platforms, APIs, and software to move data around to help power the analysts and also to expose insight to users as applications.

What software engineering skills should data scientists pick up?,"In no particular order:

SQL and database design
Every data scientist will come across databases and SQL. All the time.

ETL
Hugely underappreciated skillset, mostly because it’s not “cool”.

Python and/or R
As a data scientist today, you should master both these programming languages.

Functional programming
Machine learning caters very well to FP in my opinion. You’re not dealing with business objects, so OOP is unnecessary.

Optimization (of performance)
Not that important in other common areas of software engineering, but very important in machine learning.

Vectorization
Again, because of performance reasons it’s important to vectorize matrix operations instead of running computationally expensive nested loops.

Big data frameworks
Mostly Spark and Hadoop.

Cloud computing
A familiarity with how to utilize public cloud resources is vital for any modern software engineer or data scientist.

"Which of these careers is less stressful: Data scientist, Data engineer or software engineer? Why?","Ultimately it depends on the organization, but I would rank them by stress as follows, most to least:

 * Data Scientist
 * Data Engineer
 * Software Engineer
I’ll start with why I see Data Scientist as often the most stressful, then move onto data engineer and software engineer.

“Data Scientist” is currently an ill-defined title, meaning there a lot of misconceptions around what the role requires. Also, data science is highly experimental, which runs counter to how organizations like to manage risk and measure/track work. These issues can lead to stress and a high burnout rate among Data Scientists; something discussed at length in several articles (see references at end).

Here are some consequences:

 * hiring managers bring in a Data Scientist to work on tasks ill-suited for the role;
 * organizations have unrealistic expectations about what Machine Learning can do for them and their products;
 * there are severe disconnects between what a data scientist produces and what product managers expect;
 * friction occurs at the intersection of experimental work like machine learning and well-defined, rules-based work like software engineering;
 * data scientists end up working in isolation.
If you are working on tasks you don’t enjoy every day this will inevitably lead to stress. Countless data scientists in industry complain about being tasked with building reports and writing SQL, with little to no work in machine learning. Nobody becomes a data scientist to write SQL and build reports. This comes from an organization misconstruing data science with business intelligence/analytics.

Sometimes an organization does understand the proper role of data scientist. But then we often run into the unrealistic expectations scenario. AI is hyped beyond reason at this point, meaning companies tend to assume a Data Scientist will swoop in and magically convert their data into money-making predictions. The reality is no company has all the right data, and it takes a massive effort in experimentation to convert raw data into something that can live inside a real product and drive value, both of which have no guarantee of happening. There’s little “sexy” about this profession.

Then there’s the “PM issue.” Product managers are taught to manage traditional software projects. All their methodologies around ideation, story writing, estimation, acceptance criteria, and measuring/tracking progress grew out of managing rules-based engineering projects. Software engineers do explicitly defined tasks which produce exact outcomes. These outcomes can be tracked, measured, tested and of course discussed easily at “standup.” Data science isn’t rules-based, it requires messy exploration with unknown outcomes. Unless a PM learns how to manage projects that include data science the experience will be far less than ideal.

By the time the Data Engineer is ready to implement machine learning into the data pipeline the model has likely been validated at the proof-of-concept level, meaning there is much less uncertainty around whether machine learning can drive value. Data engineering is much more well-defined than Data Science since it is effectively rules-based engineering applied to machine learning. Specifically, data engineers help create the scaffolding that holds machine learning in place. But, I see this role as more stressful than software developer since the rules-based scaffolding must somehow mix deterministic with nondeterministic outputs. For example, while the software developer is tasked with unit testing explicit outputs, the data engineer must test for outputs that change when new data are ingested. This involves the use of thresholds and ranges, along with extensive monitoring of context drift and model performance.

Finally, Software Engineers deal with traditional, rules-based programming. This is the technology that companies think of when we speak of software. There are much fewer unrealistic expectations, program managers are trained to manage this kind of work, and software developers are the most numerous technical position in the company meaning less isolation and the ability to share workloads.

As stated from the beginning, all this depends on the organization. Some companies have developed an appreciation for how different data science is from traditional, rules-based software development, and have taken steps to merge these disciplines into an effective practice. Data scientists working for these companies are likely much less stressed.

What is the difference between a software engineer and a data scientist? Which is the best choice?,"The skills overlap, particularly in programming, but the fundamental difference is the purpose of the roles. Data scientists are about insight - teasing out patterns from data and using algorithms to create predictions and recommendations. Software engineers are about action - creating tools and applications that users interact with to drive specific outcomes

A more explicit difference also lies in the ancillary skills required outside of programming. Data scientists will need strong mathematical and statistical knowledge to be able to deploy and interpret algorithms and formulas to play with data. Software engineers need to be strong on process formulation and functional design to be able to deploy efficient code as well as user interfaces to make tools that are intuitive to users. Both roles can also benefit from knowing about the business and/or scientific domain where they will be playing in, since that determines the problems they will solve and the data they will encounter.

The two can collaborate and overlap - for example for e-commerce a data scientist might come up with an algorithm to detect associations between users and products to produce purchase recommendations. The software engineer will take the algorithm and its outputs and integrate this into a web or mobile portal that users can see which leads to product checkout if selected.

Which is best? That depends on your inclination: I’d say if you’re a detective and are concerned about discovering truths and answering questions from data, data science is for you. If you’re a builder and are concerned about creating products that solve problems for users, then software engineering is probably a better path.",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-be-both-data-scientist-software-engineer-Or-do-I-need-to-choose-between-them?top_ans=149228798,2019-06-22T13:54:31.465362+00:00,2019-06-22T13:55:15.907417+00:00,11,Dominic Ligot,https://www.quora.com/profile/Dominic-Ligot

How does a Software Engineer Do?

Programming is a part of software engineering that includes coding (or programming) to foster programming to resolve explicit issues or needs of clients. Computer programmers (coders/software engineers/designers) construct these arrangements utilising programming dialects like Java, JavaScript, C++, Scala, Swift, Kotlin, etc.

Concentrates on a show that the interest for programmers is relied upon to increment before long.

How do data Scientists Do?

DS is the field of gathering, putting away, coordinating, examining, and deciphering enormous informational indexes. A Data Scientist is one who uses an association's information to assist pioneers with settling on informed choices in light of data analysis and measurable investigation. Data Scientists may likewise apply AI and man-made consciousness procedures, just as information mining, to fabricate prescient models.

Data Scientists are popular for all intents and purposes in each industry, from monetary administrations to food conveyance.

Is Data Science Harder Than Software Engineering?

DS and programming are both innovative occupations, however, they generally require various abilities. Every job carries with it mechanical intricacies and genuine business issues. Also, every one of these fields utilises various devices, methods, and cycles to address them. Programming may be more appropriate for somebody who functions admirably inside designs and lean towards having rules and cycles to observe. DS may be better for somebody who prospers in turmoil, tracking down bits of knowledge in unstructured information.

Both programming and DS include programming somewhat. The essential contrast between the two is the end result.


%3E For programmers, the eventual outcome is programming applications and frameworks for any stage.

%3E For Data Scientists, the eventual outcome is bits of knowledge factual models, prescient calculations, representations, or reports
It is basic to note here that while Data Scientists additionally use programming to play out their capacities, they don't fabricate these product items or information design; there are computer programmers devoted to building programming answers for huge amounts of information called information engineers.

Who Earns More: Software Engineers or Data Scientists?

A profoundly experienced programmer procures $178,000 by and large, while a Data Scientist with tantamount experience and abilities acquires $155,000. (Source: Robert Half's Salary Guide.)

A comparative distinction is seen across experience and expertise levels. Be that as it may, any expert's compensation is a component of a few variables. How about we check them individually and comprehend the holes.

Pay rates by area

Payscale shows that programmers in the San Francisco Bay Area have a compensation scope of up to 40% higher than the public normal, demonstrating that Silicon Valley is as yet the fantasy objective for programmers. This is valid for Data Scientists too, however, the distinction from the public normal is marginally lower at 27%.

Seattle comes a close second for the two jobs, offering more significant compensations than the remainder of the country. With tech monsters like Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook's designing groups working out of Seattle, this shocks no one.

Compensations by top businesses

 * Probably the best tech organisations offer serious pay rates to draw in talented computer programmers just as Data Scientists.
 * Amazon and Facebook seem to pay top programmer compensations - $150,000 overall. Uber, Bloomberg, and LinkedIn approach at $140,000.
 * For Data Scientists, Apple and Facebook by and by top the rundown, firmly followed by Uber, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
Would Software Engineer be able to Become a Data Scientist?

Both being connected with innovation occupations and related fields, this progress is absolutely conceivable. On the off chance that you're a computer programmer hoping to progress, centre around creating abilities in maths, insights, information fighting, AI, information mining, information perception, and different DS abilities, either through self-learning or an internet-based course or Bootcamp. Assuming that you as of now have abilities in a programming language like Python or R, broadly utilised in DS, you're good to go.

Computer programming and DS are both exceptionally sought-after innovation occupations. Considering the amount of programming advancement today includes parts of DS, the two gatherings of experts work in equal, across comparable levels of the authoritative construction. As a rule, the distinction in pay rates for the two jobs is immaterial.

But then if you want to become a Data Scientist then the journey is so easy as a software developer.

To become a software developer all you need is the knowledge of a few programming languages and knowledge of a few frameworks and any company would hire you as a software developer after that they might give you training and then you are ready to serve the software world.

But on the other hand, if you wish to become a data scientist then you have to do a lot of hard work. Becoming a data scientist is not easy. Dealing with statistics and algorithms is a way more complex process than learning computer programming languages.

So you need expert help to become a data scientist and for a promising career.

Various expert courses for Data science aspirants are there on the web. Some of the best courses are from Simplilearn, Coursera, Learnbay, UpGrad, etc.

If you are a complete fresher with zero knowledge about the corporate world then you should join Simplilearn, Coursera, UpGrad, etc. But, if you are a working professional then you should join institutions like Learnbay.

Learnbay comes with excellent features like Domain specialisation, flexible years of subscription, live-one-to-one classes, LMS support, career guidance, job referrals, etc.

Domain Specialisation would allow you to learn Data Science even if you are in some other domain. And very few institutions provide features like domain specialisation.

So you can book free career counseling with Learnbay experts and can make the best out of it. They also provide offline classes for a Data Science course in Bangalore, Delhi, Chennai, and Gurgaon(hybrid).

Apart from these, you should do some research with other institutes before coming to the final conclusion.

Can I be a software engineer with an MIS degree or a data scientist?,"I would say the short answer is, yes.

But I don’t think that’s what you’re necessarily asking.

As someone who graduated with an MIS degree, I can tell you it is uncommon to see MIS graduates go into software engineering. I took a Java course that took me through all the classic programming concepts (variables, loops, recursion, hash tables, etc…). In conjunction with taking online courses (Harvard CS50, Fullstack Web Development, I felt I was able to develop a solid programming foundation. That being said, most MIS graduates will go into database, operations, or analysis work.

If you want to be a software engineer or data scientist, you will want to set yourself up such a way where you can understand concepts such as data structures and developing an algorithmic approach (learn about big “O” notation). It’s not that an MIS degree does not prepare you in these areas; it is most likely a C.S or D.S learning prepares you even more so.

There may be some data ""science"" courses that only focus on application, in which case these courses are simply mislabelled as ""science"".

I was a software engineer before becoming a data engineer. To me, both are super fun and challenging. I would still be happy doing either.

This is why I moved from software engineer to data engineer.

I saw that Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence was going to be super important in industry. So I studied Machine Learning and AI very intently. I was already a software engineer at this point.

I completed a Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree.

Become a Machine Learning Engineer [ https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t ]

At that point I realized that there would be a lot of demand for the people that prepared the data and kept the machine learning pipelines going. So I focused instead on becoming a Data Engineer.

Having done work as a “regular software engineer” and a “data scientist”, both at Amazon, I can definitively say that being a data scientist is far more interesting to me.

This is not to say that it’s inherently more interesting – it’s solely a predisposition I have towards wrangling big sets of data, doing statistics, and writing ML models. There are many people who find software engineering far more interesting than data science.

Software engineering is much more building-centric than data science is. You start out with a grand vision for what you want something to be, and then you go to work laying out the bricks and the beams to make that thing become a reality.

Some people adore the building, the creating.

Some people enjoy solving complex problems using cool math and novel computer science techniques. You start out with a question or a problem, and then deduce the answer using scientific reasoning.

Some people adore the experimenting, the discovering.

What distinguishes the top 1% of software engineers from the top 10%?,"I’m guessing I’ve worked close enough to make at least initial technical evaluations of about 500 people in my career. So what differentiates the top 5 from the top 50? Not much. They’re just a little bit better at everything involved.

To the person who said passion for learning, that’s simply incorrect from my experience. You can’t get into the top 10% without that. I’m not sure you can be in the top half unless you’re committed to lifelong learning.

I also disagree another poster’s suggestions that they write APIs. I wrote APIs straight out of college. It is hard to do, admittedly, but I’d expect the top 10% of any engineering population to be able to create APIs that are forward-looking, flexible, well-documented, and intuitive (the marks, I believe, of successful APIs). Likewise, if you’re trying to say only the top 1% would identify a problem and create a good library to fix it, I think the number is a lot bigger.

And what’s “top”? Being really good at both management skills and technical skills is exceedingly rare. That could be a 1% vs 10% thing.

But I suspect we’re talking about pure technical ability, so I again think, not much. Those top 5 versus the top 50 tended to have seriously scary intuition as to what’s the right thing to do. They often confuse those around them because they’re playing chess 5 moves ahead (vs. the top 10%’s 3 moves ahead). They’re a bit more confident than the other 9%. They’re also unbelievably productive. Surprisingly, at least the ones I can think of, have pretty diverse interests outside of programming.

What are the characteristics of a top 1% software developer?,"I like Ben-Ami’s answer. Here are some more points.

 * A Top Developer is Humble. They know that no matter how smart you are, you can make mistakes, and no matter how novice someone else is, they can detect them. Great devs are not annoyed when someone corrects them. They are grateful. Great devs don’t brag about what they know, but worry instead about what they don’t know yet.
 * A Top Developer is Passionate About Programming. A top developer never stops learning. They don’t just write code. They read code, and read about code. They talk to other developers about code. They never stop trying to improve their practice. They bring new techniques and behaviors to their team to improve team practice. They know that if they aren’t getting better each year, they are beginning to die.

What do the top 1% of software engineers do that the other 99% do not?,"My first inclination was to disclaim, ""I'm not top 1%, maybe top N%"" where N is some slightly higher integer, because false precision makes great humble-brags. In reality, I have a hard time identifying ""top 1%"" (where that line is, which side of it I would be on) because it depends on who's counted in the population as ""software engineers"" and who isn't. Do we count the data scientists using R? The business analysts writing Excel? Still, I think I understand the approximate level you're aiming for, and so I'm going to try to answer your question. You want to know how to become an elite engineer (2.0 on a scale I will soon introduce). 

For further reading, I wrote a couple essays on it:

The trajectory of a software engineer... and where it all goes wrong. [ http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/ ]
The shodan programmer [ http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/gervais-macleod-23-the-shodan-programmer/ ]

I'd focus on the second, and if you don't have time to read either, I'll get into the ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the theory (and the 0.0-to-3.0 scale of programmer competence) here. First, programmers tend to separate into three very broad (and overlapping) categories:

 * Adders (""level 1"", 0.0 to 1.4) who can solve most programming problems, given enough time. These tend to be the ones who do line-of-business work, write scripts to fetch data and answer questions that executives or traders care about, etc. The good ones want to progress beyond this level, remove themselves from parochial details and work on more general ""core"" problems. 
 * Multipliers (""level 2""; 1.5 to 2.4) who can select technologies, make architectural decisions, and write or maintain useful libraries. They tend to have open-source contributions to their name, speak at conferences, and are often executive-equivalent in importance to their companies. 
 * Global Multipliers (""level 3""; 2.5+) who build communities, create platforms and come up with concepts like Google's MapReduce. Their ambitions tend to out-scope most companies so they're often in academia, consulting independently, or highly paid in large firms' R&D labs.
These three abstraction levels don't tell the whole story, and of course some ""adder"" tasks are very hard (like building a production trading system) and could not be done by most ""level 1"" programmers. Then there's the altogether different issue of unqualified people being given ""level 2"" (or 3) work, such as architecture of a complex software system. Perhaps a hard L1 task is really 1.3 or 1.5 or even higher. This is just the theory.

To assess programmer level and give more of a continuum (from 0.0 to 3.0) we add a decimal point and assume that, e.g., a 2.0 programmer will succeed at 95% of level-2 tasks (and likewise for L1 and L3). At 1.5, it's 50%. At 1.0, it's 5% (relative to L2) and 95% of L1 tasks. In building the model, I assumed a logistic S-curve-- so a 1.6 programmer will succeed at 64% of L2 tasks; 1.7, 76%; 1.8, 85%; 1.9, 91%-- but I don't think it can be taken that precisely. 

At 0.7, you're able to do most straight coding tasks (although it may take a long time, and you're still not sure what this ""compiler"" thing is really doing). 1.0 is the level at which people are typically considered ""software engineers"" and 1.2 is the probably the median employed engineer, but at top tech companies it's closer to 1.6. A typical SWE 3 at Google is 1.6-1.8 but assigned 1.2-1.4 level work. A typical Sr. SWE at Google is 1.8-2.0 but assigned 1.4-1.7 level work. You might sense a pattern. The bad news is that you'll often be under-leveled at that sort of place. The good news is that the quality of most of the code at Google is quite high. On the other hand, there are plenty of companies (usually non-technical ones that still rely on software) out there that don't have a single 1.5+ engineer (or, at least, not one that they listen to) and they still need architects... so you often see those L2 decisions made by people at the 1.2-1.4 level (or by non-technical managers, which is worse) and the results are what you'd expect. 

All of this might seem like a lot of verbiage, but it's useful in answering the question. The definition of ""top 1%"" depends on whom you include in the ""programmer"" population; I'm looking for something more objective. I'd guess that there are about 200,000 programmers alive at or above the 2.0 level. That's the level I'm going to focus on. (2.5, 3.0, I can't even answer.) So how do you get to the 2.0 level?

 * Budget 7 to 14 years. Yes, it's going to take time. (I've been programming, sadly not continuously, for 8 years; I'd guess that I'm 1.9-2.0 and it took work.) You have to write code, read code, experiment with new technologies, see a few architectural failures and (one hopes, but let's not get ahead of ourselves because most ""software architects"" are politically empowered shitheads) see an architectural success or two. I think you can probably get up to 0.7-0.8 (basic code fluency) in a dedicated summer slinging Javascript, and 1.0-1.1 in another year if you really dive in. Beyond that, 0.1 point per year is a pretty aggressive clip. Most employers will assign you work below your frontier of ability, so you may have to steal an education from your boss (reading papers on work time, experimenting with new technologies). Remember: it's always better to ask forgiveness than permission. 
 * Study voraciously. Computer science is a deep field, and to be good at it, you need at least a working understanding of everything. If you think assembly code or linear algebra or strong static typing is ""scary"" or ""too deep"" you'll never reach 2.0. That doesn't mean you need to be an expert in everything because you can't. You can't have ""I won't go there"" areas. You probably don't want to be hand-writing assembly code very often, but if you take the attitude that it's ""black magic"" or ""grunt work"" or ""unclean"", then it will hinder your learning. (You see some Java programmers take this attitude toward manual-memory languages like C.) I would probably use Haskell (a high-level language with strong static typing) given a clean slate; but I've exposed myself to Clojure, C, and even Python (data science libraries) because they cover important topics from computer science. You can't have the ""Will this be on the test?"" mentality. You have to be curious about everything CS-related. (Mathematical curiosity helps.) You also need to learn about the industry itself. Why do so many software projects fail? What mistakes (technical and nontechnical) lead to that and how might they be prevented? What makes a good startup CTO? What things are worth building, and what patterns betray a death march? 
 * Build things when you don't know that you'll succeed. How do you become a competent programmer? Or architect? Or Linux kernel hacker? Practice. If you know that you can do something, then you won't learn as much as if there's some chance of failure. Employers want you at a difficulty level where you'll succeed 95% of the time. Your best learning is in the 65-75% ""stretch"" range, I'd say. That means that you're eventually getting successful outcomes, but faltering a bit. There's progress, but it's not smooth and you definitely have to work. 
 * Network, not for jobs but for ideas. Don't think of ""networking"" as something you do after you get laid off. We're social creatures and programmers are no different. The best way to become a great programmer is to go talk to other great programmers, and then get a sense of what problems they've solved and how. I'd be cautious at AI/machine learning talks in 2014 (some are very good, but there plenty of poseurs in ""data science""; that will probably change in 3 years) but Haskell and Clojure user groups both draw a great crowd. 
 * Job hop when you stop learning. Most programmers plateau around 1.2. Why? Because they aren't pushed, and they don't get opportunities to work on hard things. Or, the ""hard"" stuff they get pertains to difficult/ugly legacy code, not computer science itself. It's useful to spend ~3 months on a bad legacy module or two to learn about architectural mistakes, but not more. Ultimately, you'll want to work on successful projects, and you'll want to be surrounded by strong people. If you ever stop growing, it's time to move on. You know how people end up stagnant? One day at a time. That's also how you become a great programmer. One day at a time (for about 4,000 days).

4. It is not about the code or the language. Nor is it about 'obsession', 'knack', 'talent' or any other pseudo magical term. Simply- do they understand software beyond the level of code? Do they understand the software on the architectural level? Or can they only think about lines of code? Can they slip between mathematical abstractions of problems and software? Can they work with stakeholders to understand their needs for the system, or will they develop the system they want to code, that they think you should really want?

What distinguishes the top 1% of software engineers from the top 10%?,"Passion and desire to learn.

The top software engineers do not code because it is a means of their earning or it is a task they have to complete to meet a deadline. Its because they love to do it. They can't sleep at night knowing they are stuck on a logic.

Another thing that's constant in the software world is change. It seems like every year there’s a new hallmark programming language, framework or library that proliferates across developer blogs. First, it was all about Backbone.js. Now, everyone is raving about AngularJS and React.

All great developers have an insatiable thirst for learning.

Ultimately, it’s curiosity and genuine interest in programs that can genuinely improve programming skills.

What do the top 1% of software engineers do that the other 99% do not?,"1. Invest in learning and building tools. I've yet to meet a top engineer who didn't acquire mastery of their editor (EMACS, vi, etc), source control system, debuggers (though that's sadly going away), and programming environment. By contrast, mediocre programmers can (for example) edit code in EMACS but don't treat it like a development environment either to speed up the edit/compile/debug cycle or to reduce memory load (by off-loading knowledge of where a function is by using TAGS or some meta-search tool). Top engineers not only understand all the basic features, but usually make heavy use of the extension languages and customizability of their environment.
2. Give credit where credit is due. Again, if you're a top engineer, you don't need to hoard credit and can happily acknowledge other people's work. This makes other great people want to work with you, and it's a self-fulfilling cycle.
3. Impatience. Rather than wanting to spend time in meetings, top engineers write code, and spend time writing code rather than talking about it. Jeff Dean, Pengtoh, and Amit Singh have done major code changes to Google infrastructure without hesitancy. As Bill Coughran once said, ""You come in one morning and discover that the universe has changed.""
4. Total stack comprehension. Great software engineers don't stop at an abstraction or module boundaries. They penetrate those boundaries and attack problems or bugs until they solve them. I was once sitting down next to Pengtoh while he dug down into misbehaving code and discovered a bug in the assembly the compiler was generating. He then figured out a stable workaround for that bug. If you're intimidated by abstractions or have too much respect for module boundaries, you wouldn't have found that bug.

What distinguishes a great software engineer from a good one?,"I won't try to give a comprehensive answer to this question, but there are a few qualities I've noticed in great programmers that I don't hear mentioned too often:
 * Able to balance pragmatism and perfectionism - Great programmers have the ability to make both masterful/quick/dirty hacks and elegant/refined/robust solutions, and the wisdom to choose which is appropriate for a given problem.  Some lesser programmers seem to lack the extreme attention to detail necessary for some problems.  Others are stuck in perfectionist mode.
 * Not averse to debugging and bugfixing - Mediocre programmers often fear and loathe debugging, even of their own code.  Great programmers seem to dive right and drill down with Churchill-esque tenacity.  They might not be happy if it turns out that the bug is outside their code, but they will find it.
 * Healthy skepticism - A good programmer will get a solution that appears to work and call it a day.  A great programmer will tend to not trust their own code until they've tested it extensively.  This also comes up a lot in data analysis and system administration.  An average programmer might see a small innocuous-looking discrepancy and ignore it.  If a great programmer sees something like that they will suspect it could be a hint of a greater problem, and investigate further.  Great programmers tend to do more cross-checking and sanity checking, and in doing so discover subtle bugs.

What do the top 1% of software engineers do that the other 99% do not?,"Imagine you are a product, and you want to sell yourself to your manager for the highest possible salary. You’d want to

1. Know your customers
2. Know what you’re selling
What are you selling?

John solves LeetCode questions in 10 minutes, and codes fluently in C++, Python, and HTML. He joined Google as a new grad, and was immediately assigned to refactor legacy code.

He wondered why he was getting boring work after his straight-A performance in school, and toyed with the idea of going back to school for a PhD.

To John’s manager, John was a coder. That refactoring project needed a coder, and John fit the bill.


Manager Mike had a few more projects that needed doing.

He needed to replace the decision engine with a machine learning model. Obviously he needed a machine learning expert for that.

He needed to fix the emerging crisis that his VP was pinging him about. For this, he needed his fastest, most reliable engineer.

And he needed a tech lead. For that, he needed someone with excellent technical judgment, great stakeholder relationships, and an eye towards growing junior colleagues.

John didn’t get these tasks because he sold himself as a coder. And because John was a coder, Mike gave him the tasks that required no other skills.

Top 1% engineers know what value they bring to the table, and sell it to customers in sore need of that skillset.


Who are your customers?

Dan joined the team, and was none of these. But he was less interested in who he was, and more interested in Mike.

Mike was constantly stressed. He worked nights and weekends, and he was most stressed at the end of each quarter, when he had to report on how close the team was to its metric goals.

Dan was also given refactoring work, which he completed quickly. But he knew that Mike really needed to hit those goals every quarter.

He came up with an idea, and ran a bunch of SQL queries to show it would bump the team above its quarterly goals. Mike was intrigued, and asked his team to work on it.

The wins were delivered as promised, and Mike breathed a sigh of relief.

Dan’s wallet got so heavy he needed a new pair of pants.


The best engineers feel when people around them are struggling, and use their skills to sell them a solution. Dan could have sold himself as a SQL expert. Instead, he was the guy Mike could rely on to make sure the metrics went up.

Engineering, like every other job, is a customer service role.

"Has the bar of what makes a ""good"" software engineer gone up in recent years?","In 1980, there were about 15,000 programmers in the United States. People became programmers because they were already geeky and discovered this cool way to geek out. The mean IQ was probably 130. Today there are a couple of million programmers of various kinds in the US, so the mean IQ is probably just a little over 100. A few thousand of them are those same geeky people who would have invented programming if it hadn’t already existed. But now, people want to be programmers because they hear it pays well, without regard to whether they have any aptitude. People who can’t even get college degrees want to be programmers and go to those boot camps. It’s nuts.

The half dozen big companies (amazon, facebook, google, ibm, microsoft, ???) with enough cash to pay top salaries are fixated on the top 1 per cent of talent, if only they could figure out what that was. The other companies also think they can find that top 1 per cent, and not even pay them top wages. These other companies have even less clue about what top talent looks like because top talent are unicorns. Everybody’s heard of them but hardly anybody has ever actually seen one.

It’s this fixation on top talent that makes it feel like the bar has been raised. So everybody hires entry level talent without much expectation that they are top talent. But companies hiring senior staff always hunt for unicorns. That makes it hard to change jobs even for people who are reasonably talented, but perhaps don’t have a horn growing out of their heads. Getting hired means fooling some manager into thinking you look a lot like a unicorn. That this works may be evidence that the IQ of managers has also regressed to the mean.

The job market has also changed a lot since 1980. In 1980 practically every software project was new code. Top talent were people who could design clear interfaces, APIs, and data structures, and turn a blank screen into a functioning product. Today, practically every software project is an add-on to a creaky, 10-year-old, million-line code base with no documentation and a mountain of technical debt. Top talent in this environment can code and test quickly and suppress their gag reflex over the ugly hack they are producing. It’s a very different skill set to greenfield programming.

In 1980, every program stood alone. It needed to work all the time. If a text editor discarded every 1,000th character at random, it would be completely unusable. Today, web sites can often appear pretty functional even if they have serious bugs. If it drops every 1,000th page request at random, the hapless user just reloads and probably doesn’t even notice the application has failed. This means that the oafs who were utterly unsuited for serious work 30 years ago have a much better chance of finding employment today.

The industry is stratifying into high-skilled and low-skilled teams. At the bottom of the heap are jobs that can be outsourced to third-world programmers fresh out of 2-year training schools. At the top are the incredibly brainy people needed to build compilers, databases, and space shuttle flight control software. There are mythical 10x programmers for both these strata, but they are evaluated by different managers and compared against a different background average.",https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-top-1-of-software-engineers-from-the-top-10?top_ans=23728381,2016-06-10T05:29:31.032690+00:00,,360,Kurt Guntheroth,https://www.quora.com/profile/Kurt-Guntheroth-1
Do software engineering managers always rank their engineers in their minds?,"I can’t speak for other engineering managers, but I certainly don’t do it, and it’s a stupid thing to do, in my opinion.

If you forced me to, I can tell you the job levels of everyone on the team, and their latest ratings, which sort of indicates how much relatively speaking each contributed over the last period. The way this works at Facebook, this mechanically translates into the semi-annual bonus amount they are getting, and you can sort on that, if you insist. (You can tell I am a software engineer - I can always sort a list). But they all contributed different things. I can’t replace A with B on a project willy-nilly, even if under some sort of ranking function B %3E A. In many cases, A contributed a really important thing that B is incapable of, while the same is true the other way around.

So, I don’t have a ranked list, but I do have the following in my head:

1. Who are the leads on the team? These are the people who are organizationally important, they run the projects.
2. Who are the domain experts for each area? These people are the ones the rest of the team goes to if they have a question or need help.
3. Who are the best at execution (most productive)? These people you go to if you need a lot of head-down work done.
Those who are in the first category are the most senior. But, roughly, if you are in one of these three categories, you are a senior engineer, and I would go a very long way to avoid losing you. People who aren’t in any of these categories are more junior, and are not in the same tier as the first two sets, and my goal is to grow them into the senior category.

I don’t think I would rank anyone pairwise, outside of this rough categorization.",https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-top-1-of-software-engineers-from-the-top-10?top_ans=302573423,2021-08-17T22:40:53.828164+00:00,,228,Dmitriy Genzel,https://www.quora.com/profile/Dmitriy-Genzel
What distinguishes the Top 1% of product managers from the Top 10%?,"The top 10% of product managers excel at a few of these things. The top 1% excel at most or all of them:
 * Think big - A 1% PM's thinking won't be constrained by the resources available to them today or today's market environment. They'll describe large disruptive opportunities, and develop concrete plans for how to take advantage of them.
 * Communicate - A 1% PM can make a case that is impossible to refute or ignore. They'll use data appropriately, when available, but they'll also tap into other biases, beliefs, and triggers that can convince the powers that be to part with headcount, money, or other resources and then get out of the way.
 * Simplify - A 1% PM knows how to get 80% of the value out of any feature or project with 20% of the effort. They do so repeatedly, launching more and achieving compounding effects for the product or business. 
 * Prioritize - A 1% PM knows how to sequence projects. They balance quick wins vs. platform investments appropriately. They balance offense and defense projects appropriately. Offense projects are ones that grow the business. Defense projects are ones that protect and remove drag on the business (operations, reducing technical debt, fixing bugs, etc.). 
 * Forecast and measure - A 1% PM is able to forecast the approximate benefit of a project, and can do so efficiently by applying past experience and leveraging comparable benchmarks. They also measure benefit once projects are launched, and factor those learnings into their future prioritization and forecasts.
 * Execute - A 1% PM grinds it out. They do whatever is necessary to ship. They recognize no specific bounds to the scope of their role. As necessary, they recruit, they produce buttons, they do bizdev, they escalate, they tussle with internal counsel, they *.
 * Understand technical trade-offs - A 1% PM does not need to have a CS degree. They do need to be able to roughly understand the technical complexity of the features they put on the backlog, without any costing input from devs. They should partner with devs to make the right technical trade-offs (i.e. compromise).
 * Understand good design - A 1% PM doesn't have to be a designer, but they should appreciate great design and be able to distinguish it from good design. They should also be able to articulate the difference to their design counterparts, or at least articulate directions to pursue to go from good to great.
 * Write effective copy - A 1% PM should be able to write concise copy that gets the job done. They should understand that each additional word they write dilutes the value of the previous ones. They should spend time and energy trying to find the perfect words for key copy (button labels, nav, calls-to-action, etc.), not just words that will suffice.

I'm not sure I've ever met a 1% PM, certainly not one that I identified as such prior to hiring. Instead of trying to hire one, you're better off trying to hire a 10% PM who strives to develop and improve along these dimensions.",https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-top-1-of-software-engineers-from-the-top-10?top_ans=1262407,2012-06-02T17:23:14.443711+00:00,2012-06-02T17:24:39.504818+00:00,5752,Ian McAllister,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ian-McAllister

I use simple rather than complex constructs — I know that many programmers argue that efficiency is code “shortness” (i.e. terseness) is superior to readability. I respectfully disagree. I write comments. I explain both the overall function of my code as well as the individual things that the code does. Perhaps many programmers do not need comments and perhaps code is “self-documenting”, but I prefer to explain my code in plain English — if I cannot explain it in English something is wrong.

What separates the top one percent of computer programmers from the top ten percent?,"my2cents, Adding to Lior:

 * C programming experience- yes, C is rare and just the thought of coding my product in C gives me the chill... but a great developer knows what's going on under the hood...You can't build or plan large scale projects without this solid knowledge. You should code in higher languages, but you should also know why the most efficient code you'll ever create will be in C.
 * Multidisciplinary - The more, the merrier... Knowing several languages, frameworks and environments is a must. You should pick one you like and master it for ~2 years and than learn another one. Being able to create any prototype (website, software, mobile app, server..) using your skills is pure gold. 
 * Don't be an alien - read some tech news, tech blogs, anything you like.. don't be an alien and ask what is Instagram or Hadoop or GitHub You don't have to use it, just know what it is.

 * Some QA and testing experience -  ""If you created the problem, how can you be the one to fix it?"" - A great developer spends at least 3 hours before writing any code by planning and forecasting future problems (scalability, compatibility, security, future features etc) 
 * Know the vision and the road map - Know what the company is going after in the long run, what's the business model, what's planned for the future, Localization and more languages? API for developers? Thousands of users? know what's going on and understand the product.

 * Some basic UX / UI skills
 * Be organized - Organize your builds, source code, resources, links etc.. so that even if you are sick, another developer can easily continue your work.
 * Never say 'No' or Can't '- Anything is possible, it's just a matter of tradeoffs and resources. So don't say 'No, I can't do that', instead, say 'I can do that but {explain the tradeoffs} or 'let me see what I can do'...

 * 'Self-managing' - manage yourself, your code and your tasks, don't be a burden on your managers / partners / co-workers.
 * Consider contributing to Open Source projects - just because it's an ocean of knowledge and opportunities. Start small, fix some bugs or contribute a small feature.

What amazing things can Python do?,"Function decorators are particularly neat in Python. They allow you to enhance the functionality of existing functions.

Let me demonstrate with a simple example of calculating the factorial of a number recursively:

[code]def factorial(n):
   if n == 0:
      return 1
   return n * factorial(n - 1)
[/code]One way to speed up this function is to use Memoization [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization ]. Using decorators, this can be easily achieved:

[code]def memoize(f):
   cache = {}

   def inner(n):
      if n not in cache:
         cache[n] = f(n)
      return cache[n]

   return inner

@memoize
def factorial(n):
   if n == 0:
      return 1
   return n * factorial(n - 1)
[/code]One call to factorial results in the cache building up for all numbers %3C n. Next time you invoke factorial for a number %3C n, the result is not computed but fetched from the cache. This makes it easy to separate out the cache maintaining logic from the function being decorated. 

@memoize is syntactic sugar for:

[code]factorial = memoize(factorial)
[/code]To make the memoize function more general (the way I use it often):

[code]def memoize(f):
    cache = {}

    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = f(*args, **kwargs)
        return cache[args]

    inner.__name__ = 'memoized_' + f.__name__
    return inner
[/code]This makes it possible to use it for functions with different number and types of arguments. The arguments that should be the cache key must be passed positionally (normally) while the others should be named arguments. Any mutable objects should also be passed as named arguments because Python doesn't allow mutable dictionary keys. To illustrate with an example:

[code]@memoize
def find_path(source, graph=graph, path=[]):
...
[/code]Here, graph and path are passed as named arguments.

The line below renames the ""name"" attribute of the function with the name of the actual function being decorated. This is helpful for debugging because the value of __name__ is printed in a stack trace. There is actually a library function (functools.wraps) that does this.

[code]inner.__name__ = 'memoized_' + f.__name__
[/code]

This is just one example of how function decorators in Python can be used. Another quick example for the web developers:

[code]@requires_login
def home_page():
...

What amazing things can Python do?,"Python can be used to so much of serious stuff when you get to know it better. It is good at fun stuff too! Recently I did this using a module in python called ""Turtle Graphics"". I drew a tree using Fractals!

Python is amazingly cool if only we learn to use it well!


Update : 10216. 

Last night, I lost interest in everything and was looking for some new ways to kill time.  And as I was thinking, something struck me like a thunder striking a lonely tree in a desert! I played the Snake game a lot as a kid and ever since I took Computer Science I wanted to write this game. I knew that the logistics were simple but every time I start something used to get in way. But last night, that didn't happen. So, I sat straight from 9PM to 5:10 AM in the morning and completed writing the code. It was one of the yureka moments of my life. I used a specialized module in python called Pygame. 

+1 for Pygame. And I am looking forward to write more of my childhood fantasy games. 

Here is the link to the code if someone wants to give it a try. 

rajiv256/Pygames [ https://github.com/rajiv256/Pygames/tree/master/Snake ] 

I did it in Linux and I just had to install pygame and run the .py file as a regular file on the command line. 

To install Pygame from command line :



%3E sudo apt-get install python-pygame

What are some interesting things to do with Python? I want to make something related to big data or machine learning.,"You just learned Python and immediately want to start on machine learning or big data? I won't try to talk you out of it.

Kaggle  [ http://kaggle.com/ ]is a great place to start a pre-fabricated machine learning project. Don't expect any new and remarkable results though.

If you want to do something that hasn't been done a thousand times, consider getting some data from Factual [ http://factual.com ]. Factual has a nice API and offers large free data sets (limited query rate of 10,000 per day). The query limit precludes you from doing BIG data too soon, but you can accumulate it over time or just settle for medium-sized data. You can get all sorts of information on places all around the world. Some that information is actually generated using machine learning algorithms, like “existence”: the probability a place currently exists. You could:

1. try to recreate their “existence” score. This will be pretty difficult, but is definitely machine learning.
2. study patterns in the names of places. This is more data-oriented, but has plenty of extensions into ML.
3. determine what type of restaurant is most popular in each area (obviously NYC will be different from a small town in Kentucky). Type would be a combination of cuisine, price, etc… Factual has all the data you'd need to do this.
4. examine whether the length of a place’s name has a large effect on its popularity. Obviously if it has a name that takes 5 minutes to say, word of mouth advertising won't do much good. But if the name is too short it may be common and get confused with other places. What's the perfect length? Factual has a “PlaceRank” which is a measure of popularity you could use for this.
5. Determine which airports have the hungriest people. By that, I mean the airports with the most meals purchased per person passing through.
6. ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT! The dataset is huge and very well documented and maintained. There are countless things you can do with it.

What amazing things can Python do?,"Thanks for the A2A.

I always wanted to write into this topic, but never had the courage to do it, so here it comes.

Alot of answers here use the Standard Library to show the power of python. Some other use specific modules/libraries to show projects that can be done with python.

I am a big fan of python packages, I am collecting them like others do collect pennies, because I think thats the most awesome part of Python. So, what I am going to do is 2 parts. Showing some secrets of commonly used libraries and then presenting some libraries that are not so well known.

1. youtube-dl
Okay, nearly everyone has heard of youtube-dl. Everyone uses it to download youtube videos, which is alot better than other options (websites with ads, programs that install other software on the computer)

What most dont know or dont realize: it doesnt stop at youtube. youtube-dl can deal with alot of websites, like bbc, clipfish etc. The question is rather, what CANT youtube-dl deal with? youtube-dl: Supported sites [ https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html ] 

2. Using Python to solve your polynomials? NO WAY

Forget wolfram alpha, you have python!

[code]from numpy import poly1d
p = poly1d([3, 2, 1]) 
print(p) #3x²+2x+1
print(p(2)) #plugs in 2 for x =%3E 17
print(p([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) #[ 6 17 34 57 86]
print(p*p) # 9x^4 + 12 x^3 + 10 x^2 + 4 x + 1
print(p.deriv()) # 6 x + 2
print(p.r) #shows the roots of the equation.
[/code]More informations here:

numpy.poly1d - NumPy v1.10 Manual [ http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.poly1d.html ] 

3. Want to easily do Sentiment Analysis? Use Textblob! 

Why do you want to reinvent the wheel? There are so many useful libraries out there that do exactly what you want!



[code]from textblob import TextBlob
print(TextBlob(""I am  happy that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am very happy that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am not  happy that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am not very happy that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am sad that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am very sad that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am not sad that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
print(TextBlob(""I am not very sad that you are reading my answer"").sentiment)
#results
#Sentiment(polarity=0.8, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=1.0, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=-0.4, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=-0.3076923076923077, subjectivity=0.7692307692307692)
#Sentiment(polarity=-0.5, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=-0.65, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=0.25, subjectivity=1.0)
#Sentiment(polarity=0.1923076923076923, subjectivity=0.7692307692307692)
[/code]4. Every wanted to find out how close 2 strings are without being equal? Or find out the closest match?

Enter fuzzywuzzy!

[code]%3E%3E%3E fuzz.ratio(""this is a test"", ""this is a test!"")
    96
%3E%3E%3E fuzz.partial_ratio(""this is a test"", ""this is a test!"")
    100
%3E%3E%3E choices = [""Atlanta Falcons"", ""New York Jets"", ""New York Giants"", ""Dallas Cowboys""]
%3E%3E%3E process.extract(""new york jets"", choices, limit=2)
    [('New York Jets', 100), ('New York Giants', 78)]
%3E%3E%3E process.extractOne(""cowboys"", choices)
    (""Dallas Cowboys"", 90)
[/code]Examples from here: seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy [ https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy ] 

5. Everyone knows regular expressions. Did you know that you can easily generate String that fit the regular expression?



[code]%3E%3E%3E import exrex

%3E%3E%3E exrex.getone('(ex)r\\1')
'exrex'

%3E%3E%3E list(exrex.generate('((hai){2}|world!)'))
['haihai', 'world!']

%3E%3E%3E exrex.getone('\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}-[0-9]{4}')
'3096-7886-2834-5671'

%3E%3E%3E exrex.getone('(1[0-2]|0[1-9])(:[0-5]\d){2} (A|P)M')
'09:31:40 AM'

%3E%3E%3E exrex.count('[01]{0,9}')
1023

%3E%3E%3E print '\n'.join(exrex.generate('This is (a (code|cake|test)|an (apple|elf|output))\.'))
This is a code.
This is a cake.
This is a test.
This is an apple.
This is an elf.
This is an output.

%3E%3E%3E print exrex.simplify('(ab|ac|ad)')
(a[bcd])

What are some amazing things you can do with Python?,"There is a non-exhaustive list of amazing things that you can do with python there is so much you can do.

some most amazing things include...

Creating  a file server with just 

[code]python -m SimpleHTTPServer #default port 8080
[/code]this line creates  file server, now any device that is on the network can access files from your P.C. I do it all the times when i have to shift some movies to my mobile ,i can browse my whole computer from my mobile. 

Here are some screenshots

This is my PC

and here's my phone,full access to every folder


this is amazing..

Some other things that i've managed to do keeping file in Well Organised manner. I am really very bad at keeping files in their correct folder, after a week or two there is   chaos but what i managed to do was create a script that can take files and keep them in their respective folders like all images in one folder,python files in another, office files and so on with just one click. some screeshots...

Before

After file_organiser.py(you can see it ) was clicked

Now, automating daily life things are other field where python performs better and can surely be amazing. like i am currently working on this one , reading all the movie   files names( i have an movies folder) and downloading all information about it from imdb which include story line, cast, reviews and rating and saving them alongside movies. you can do this all with python. 

Cricket score notification is yet another amazing thing for which you can write a script and i've also did so. it just pops up the score after a period of time. libraries like beautifulsoup are such a great help in these cases.(screenshots are not available because that script is in ubuntu (i've dual booted the system) i will edit the answer later).


Want to read zen of python: just do this

[code]%3E%3E%3Eimport this
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit. 
Simple is better than complex. 
Complex is better than complicated. 
Flat is better than nested. 
Sparse is better than dense. 
Readability counts. 
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. 
Although practicality beats purity. 
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. 
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. 
Now is better than never. 
Although never is often better than *right* now. 
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. 
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

What are some interesting things to do with Python? I want to make something related to big data or machine learning.,"The author of this content is: Mr. Praveen Kumar.

A few years ago, when I was in college, I attended a workshop organized by FOSSEE [ http://python.fossee.in/ ] and it was in this workshop that I met ""Python"" and fell in love with her at first sight. I was amazed at how easy it was to write simple solutions to complex problems in Python. One of the utility I learnt at the workshop was an image to ASCII art generator.

How it works?

We scale a given image to a standard resolution that suitably represents the ASCII version of a given image. The scaled version is then converted to a grayscale image. In a grayscale image, there are 256 shades of gray, or in other words, each pixel carries only the intensity information which is represented by an 8 bit value. A pixel with a value of 0 is assumed to be black and the one with 255 is assumed to be white. We divide the whole range of 0-255 into 11 smaller ranges of 25 pixels each and then assign each pixel a character according to the range it falls in. The point is to assign a group of pixels with slightly varying intensity the same ASCII char. We use the PIL library to play with the images. The code given below is almost self explanatory. The default char mapping and resolution doesn't render good ASCII arts for every image size and so you should try modifying the char mapping and image size to the one that best represents the given image.

Here are some ASCII arts:

Dependencies:

PIL(Python Imaging Library)

Under Ubuntu

[code]$ sudo pip install Pillow

[code]ASCII_CHARS = [ '#', '?', '%', '.', 'S', '+', '.', '*', ':', ',', '@']

    """"""
    (original_width, original_height) = image.size
    aspect_ratio = original_height/float(original_width)
    new_height = int(aspect_ratio * new_width)

    new_image = image.resize((new_width, new_height))
    return new_image

def convert_to_grayscale(image):
    return image.convert('L')

def map_pixels_to_ascii_chars(image, range_width=25):
    """"""Maps each pixel to an ascii char based on the range
    in which it lies.

    0-255 is divided into 11 ranges of 25 pixels each.
    """"""

    pixels_in_image = list(image.getdata())
    pixels_to_chars = [ASCII_CHARS[pixel_value/range_width] for pixel_value in
            pixels_in_image]

    return """".join(pixels_to_chars)

def convert_image_to_ascii(image, new_width=100):
    image = scale_image(image)
    image = convert_to_grayscale(image)

    pixels_to_chars = map_pixels_to_ascii_chars(image)
    len_pixels_to_chars = len(pixels_to_chars)

    image_ascii = [pixels_to_chars[index: index + new_width] for index in
            xrange(0, len_pixels_to_chars, new_width)]

"What are some real-life projects that can be made with Python? To prevent confusion on what I mean by “real-life projects”, this is generally what I mean: Projects that can be used to do real tasks.","One day I was driving back from work and I wanted to know which movies where playing at the theater near my house. So, I did the search on my phone and it took me about 5 to 7 minutes to find the movies that were playing on that day. I hate searching my phone while driving because now I have to “Multi Task” and worry about not wrecking the car. So, I thought why not write a program that will send me one text message everyday with details of the movies (name, date playing, show timings ). So, I wrote first part of the program that goes to the website and parse the information that I want and store it in Json format. Now all I have to do is use Twilio API and have it send to my phone and add a cron job.

Here the code, just in case you are interested. You will need to download PhantomJs and put it in the same directory as this file.

This is just a small example and what you can do is limited to your imagination:)

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from selenium import webdriver

data = {}

browser = webdriver.PhantomJS(""./phantomjs.exe"")
browser.get('http://www.galaxytheatres.com/Browsing/Cinemas/Details/3')

# Parse html
soup = BeautifulSoup(browser.page_source, ""html.parser"")
gData = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'film-showtimes'})

# Total number of movies
movieTotal = len([movie.text for movie in soup.find_all('h3', {'class': 'film-title'})])

for i in range(movieTotal):
    # Get movie name
    movieTitle = gData[i].find('h3', {'class': 'film-title'}).text

    # Get date when movie is showing
    movieDate = gData[i].find('h4', {'class': 'session-date'}).text
    movieDate = movieDate.split(',')[1].strip()

    # Get movie Timings
    timing = list(gData[i].find('div', {'class': 'session-times'}))
    timing = [element for element in timing if element != '\n']
    movieTiming = [time.find('time').text for time in timing]

    # Storing everything in json format
    data.update({i: {'name': movieTitle, 'date': movieDate, 'timing': movieTiming}})

# Sorting dictionary by date
sortedData = sorted(data.values(), key=itemgetter('date'))

# Converting [ {}, {} ] to { {}, {} }
jsonData = {i:item for i, item in enumerate(sortedData)}

# Writing dictionary to .json file

What is an interesting project a beginner Python programmer can start?,"I always get beginners to write a program that crawls the internet and downloads every image that it finds. Get's the size (height and width) of the image, hash it MD5, SHA256 and delete the file. Save information in the database - don't download it again. Gather more information like country of origin etc

Run the program for a week. Without it crashing!

Then write a program to extract some statistics about what you have found. Where did you go in the crawl? How many files found? How many Unique? Average size of image? etc etc etc

It's fun, interesting and with so much information being online will stand you in good stead for writing data gathering applications in the future.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-things-to-do-with-Python-I-want-to-make-something-related-to-big-data-or-machine-learning?top_ans=9015277,2015-01-06T08:40:25.243695+00:00,,45,Dave Gordon,https://www.quora.com/profile/Dave-Gordon-17
What are some interesting things to do with Python? I want to make something related to big data or machine learning.,"Python allows you to do many cool things. Do you want to build a website with a backend , Python has Django/Flask to support it. Do you want to build a GUI application(i.e a desktop app) , Python has pyQt/Tkinter for it. Do you want to predict stocks for the next few days based on the previous years data, Python has scikit-learn for it. Do you want to take screenshots of 100 webpages without visiting them manually , python has Selenium for it. The applications are endless. I will list down some of the famous libraries and their applications.

1. Web development :- You can develop a website with a backend supporting REST api using python frameworks such as Django / Flask.

2. Game development :- You can develop a video game using module Pygame.

3. Computer Vision :- You can do interesting things such as Face detection, Color detection using Opencv with python

4. Web scraping :- Want to get data from a website but the website doesn't have an api to expose data? You can use scraping. Most of the News aggregators, e-commerce price comparison websites such as buyhatke do web scraping.Python has Requests, BeautifulSoup , Scrapy to support web scraping.

5. Machine Learning :- You can do cool things such as predicting stocks, finger print identification, spam detection etc. using machine learning. Python has modules scikit-learn , theano, tensorflow to support it. Currently Deep Learning is all the hype and Tensorflow has support for Deep Learning.

6. GUI development :- To develop a cross-platform desktop application python can be used. Python has modules Tkinter, PyQt to support it.

7. Robotics :- Raspberry pi can be used as a brain to the robot to perform various actions and to react to the environment and the coding on a Raspberry pi can be done using python.

8. Data Analysis :- Data whenever obtained either online or offline would not be properly formatted with various issues such as missing values etc. This data can be cleaned using Pandas. And to find patterns from the data Matplotlib can be used in visualizing the data. These are used as a first step in machine learning before applying any ML algo.

"What are some real-life projects that can be made with Python? To prevent confusion on what I mean by “real-life projects”, this is generally what I mean: Projects that can be used to do real tasks.","I made and uses :

1. A script that go into my download folder every hours and tidy up everything, order by resolution, by names, removes known bad files, etc (first script I did, I was a student back then, ugliest code I’ve ever written, but still works :p)
2. A script that scan a whole folder and subfolders and will tell you exactly what modifications where made later
3. a script that retieve from my 3d scanner 21 pictures, order them, if one of the camera failed it uses the timestamp meta data to know in what scan the pictures is suposed to be, make photo preview, etc
4. A bot that bypass captcha using a OCR librairy and request a lot from bitcoin faucet :p, I gave up however, too high maintenance for too little gain.
5. A funny name generator : 40 names, huhdreds of adjectives, you get suff like combat-butterfly, stealth-cannibal, chemical-octopus, I use it everytime I need a name somewhere, around 21000 unique names
Right now I’m looking at little internet 2d games that allow you to earn money, if they are just based on agility I could make a python bot that read the screen and play the game…..then get money.

PS : oh I forgot, theere is a high traffic website that allow people to sell their stuff to other people; I made a script that search the website every 5 minutes for objects I wants and email me as soon as it find something at interesting prices.

(Some times you can find high end DSLR 10 times cheaper than their market value, those are usually sold in the first 30 minutes)

What are some interesting things to do with Python? I want to make something related to big data or machine learning.,"I read a lot of Cool tricks here,I wonder if anyone mentioned this, anyways! I am going to share You this Little trick which i find very pythonic!

Understanding the underscore( _ ) of Python!

There are 5 cases for using the underscore in Python.

1. For storing the value of last expression in interpreter.
2. For ignoring the specific values. (so-called “I don’t care”)
3. To give special meanings and functions to name of vartiables or functions.
4. To use as ‘Internationalization(i18n)’ or ‘Localization(l10n)’ functions.
5. To separate the digits of number literal value.
Let’s look at each case.

When used in interpreter

The python interpreter stores the last expression value to the special variable called ‘_’. This feature has been used in standard CPython interpreter first and you could use it in other Python interpreters too.

For Ignoring the values

The underscore is also used for ignoring the specific values. If you don’t need the specific values or the values are not used, just assign the values to underscore.

Give special meanings to name of variables and functions

The underscore may be most used in ‘naming’. The PEP8 which is Python convention guideline introduces the following 4 naming cases.

_single_leading_underscore
This convention is used for declaring private variables, functions, methods and classes in a module. Anything with this convention are ignored in [code ]from module import *[/code]. 
However, of course, Python does not supports truly private, so we can not force somethings private ones and also can call it directly from other modules. So sometimes we say it “weak internal use indicator”.

single_trailing_underscore_
This convention could be used for avoiding conflict with Python keywords or built-ins. You might not use it often.

__double_leading_underscore
This is about syntax rather than a convention. double underscore will mangle the attribute names of a class to avoid conflicts of attribute names between classes. (so-called “mangling” that means that the compiler or interpreter modify the variables or function names with some rules, not use as it is) 
The mangling rule of Python is adding the “_ClassName” to front of attribute names are declared with double underscore. 
That is, if you write method named “__method” in a class, the name will be mangled in “_ClassName__method” form.

And the best One is this:

To separate the digits of number literal value

This feature was added in Python 3.6. It is used for separating digits of numbers using underscore for readability.

How can I make learning Python interesting and exciting?,"Learning Python can be made interesting and exciting in several ways:
1. Real-world projects: Choose projects that interest you and build them using Python. This could be anything from creating a simple game to automating a mundane task.
2. Interactive learning: Use interactive online platforms or tools that provide hands-on coding experience. There are many websites and apps that offer gamified learning experiences.
3. Join a community: Engage with the Python community through forums, meetups, or online groups. Sharing your progress and learning from others can make the process more enjoyable.
4. Explore different applications: Python is used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Exploring these applications can show you the practical value of learning Python.
5. Pair programming: Partnering with someone else to work on coding challenges or projects can make learning Python more social and enjoyable.
6. Celebrate milestones: Set achievable goals and celebrate your progress. This could be completing a challenging project, solving a difficult problem, or mastering a new concept.
Remember, the key is to stay curious and find ways to apply Python to things that genuinely interest you.",https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-make-learning-Python-interesting-and-exciting?top_ans=1477743714668375,2023-11-29T07:34:30.780617+00:00,,,ChatGPT,
How do I learn Python?,"The most important question to answer first is why do I want to learn python? Answering this will guide what you use to learn and how you learn.

Starting with a very generic list of resources to learn python when you eventually want to make websites (for example), will not only reduce your motivation, it will also make it much harder to apply the knowledge you gain.  I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.

When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.

1.  Find what motivates you

Finding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.

Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.

Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.

Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:
 * Websites
 * Mobile apps
 * Games
 * Data science/Machine learning

2.  Learn some basic python syntax

Unless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.

For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.

Some resources that can help you:

 * Codecademy [ http://www.codecademy.com ] -- does a good job of teaching basic syntax.
 * Learn python the hard way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] -- a book that teaches a lot of python concepts.

 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] -- this is my startup.  It's focused on teaching python for data science, but it teaches all the basic syntax also.
 * The Python Tutorial [ https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ ] -- the tutorial on the main python site.

I can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.

3.  Make structured projects in your chosen area

Unless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.

When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:

Games
 * Codecademy  [ http://www.codecademy.com- ]-- walks you through making a couple of simple games.
 * Pygame tutorials [ http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials ] -- pygame (the python library for making games) has a good list of tutorials
 * Making games with pygame [ http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982106017 ] -- this book looks like a great way to learn python by making games

Websites
 * Flask tutorial [ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/ ] -- the official flask (simple python web framework) tutorial.
 * Bottle tutorial [ http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html ] -- Bottle (even simpler web framework for python) tutorial. 

 * How To Tango With Django 1.7 [ http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/ ] -- a guide to using django (more complex python web framework)
Mobile apps
 * Kivy guide [ http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html-- ] -- Kivy is the tool that lets you make mobile apps with python.  They have a guide on how to get started.
Data science
 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] --  Teaches you python and data science interactively.  You analyze a series of interesting datasets ranging from CIA documents to NBA player stats.
 * Scikit-learn documentation [ http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html ] -- Scikit-learn (the main machine learning library for python) has some great documentation and tutorials.
 * Python for Data Analysis [ http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do ] -- written by the author of a major python data analysis library (pandas), it's a good introduction to analyzing data in python.

4.  Work on projects on your own

Once you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.

Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.

Some ideas:
 *  Extend the projects you were working on previously, and add more functionality.
 * Go to python meetups in your area, and find people who are working on interesting projects.
 * Find open source packages to contribute to.
 * See if any local nonprofits are looking for volunteer developers.
 * Find projects other people have made, and see if you can extend or adapt them.
My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.

The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.

5.  Keep working on harder projects

Keep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.

Here are some ideas for when that time comes:
 * Try teaching a novice how to do your current project.
 * Try load testing your website -- can you scale it up?
 * Can you make your program run faster?

Going forward

At the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it. 

You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.

Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-make-learning-Python-interesting-and-exciting?top_ans=13841814,2015-07-07T13:40:55.951227+00:00,,3046,Vik Paruchuri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vik-Paruchuri
What should I do in Python to get better?,"Normally I would say that the more you spend time coding the better you get. But this is not actually true. I know so many programmers that are absolute shit when it comes to Python. All this despite having years behind them.

Now why is this?

Simple. They only learn something when they have to. They don't actually try to learn how the language works internally or it what makes it special. Most programmers would call such people generalists. They can work across multiple frameworks easily. But they will never be good at one framework.

So what can you do ?

Ask yourself if you want to be a generalist or a specialist. Then. Only then, can you move on to the question of getting “better” at python.

Python is an art in itslef. It's the fact that it's has such a simple syntax that it decieves so many into diving in blind. Sure, you can get a lot of the mundane things done very fast. But try to write a web framework with it and you'll see yourself running into problems very fast.

Okay so now that we know what Python is like. Let's delve into how we can actually get good at Python.

Rule #1

Do everything you've ever been advised to never do in Python.

“Wait…what?”

That's right. If you're always avoiding the tricky things in Python, when you actually need to do something that requires it, you will be hopelessly lost.

I'm not saying , use this in production. But work on side projects where you have much more freedom to experiment.

eg: If you heard someone say to never use threading. Then use it. You will realize you need to use it with asyncio or UI frameworks later on. If you skip on it now, then you suffer later.

Rule #2

Don't use Python for everything. Python isn't good at everything.

No. Don't write your video games with Python. That is a bad idea. What I'm trying to tell you is that you need to figure what Python's use cases are.

Rule #3

Build an app or apps.

Don't just learn the concepts or the frameworks. Build something. The technical challenges involved will force you to learn as you go.

Rule #4

Talk to the community.

Volunteer your time on IRC to help our newbies. You'd be surprised by the number of frameworks you'll hear about in a week.

Rule #5

Fancy syntax, generators and list comprehension are generally useless.

You don't look cool when you combine a list comprehension, map and a filter together when you could have just used a for loop. If a newbie can understand your code, then your python code is excellent.

Rule #6

Use logging everywhere.

You wouldn't believe how helpful it is to have a logger in your code. It's like print() statements everywhere. Except you don't have to remove them before you commit. Debugging will be smooth sailing from here on out.

Rule #7

Watch talks on python by it's core developers.

Yes that's right. Simply watching a talk by Raymond Hettinger is good enough to make you a Python God in front of your colleagues. The core developers know what they are talking about and the best way to do something in python.

Quoting the Zen of Python.


%3E There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Keep these rules in mind and you'll do slightly better overall. Which is miles as far as Python goes.

Good luck to ya :)

There are many other websites where you can solve such problems daily like

 * Euler project
 * Stack overflow
 * Reddit questions
 * Coding bat
 * Code Abbey etc.
Or if you don’t like to code, simply read interesting answers and it will be fun,

 * What is something that almost nobody knows about the Python coding language? [ https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-that-almost-nobody-knows-about-the-Python-coding-language ]

You can try few long term projects as well, like building games and websites. But these are time consuming (based on complexity of game and website) and I am pretty sure you will loose the interest in between and quit. So before you start, make sure you are going to finish it.

Try these games if you love gaming. These are very basic games.

 * Nibbles: A worm or snake constantly moves around the board. The player controls the direction the ""head"" of the worm moves, and the worm must try to eat apples that randomly appear. Eating an apply causes the worm to grow in length. The game ends if the worm crashes into the edge of the board or into itself.
 * Tetris: Shapes made up of four blocks fall from the top of the board. The player must rotate and place them to create full rows with no gaps. When a full row is made, the blocks in that row disappear and the blocks above it move down. The game ends if the board fills up.
 * Tic-tac-toe: Players put down their X or O symbol on a 3x3 board and try to get three in a row.
 * Blackjack: Blackjack is a classic card game that is simple enough to implement a dealer AI for.
 * Chess: You refer wiki for rules of the game.
 * Alien attack: A few rows of enemies gradually makes they are way down to the player. The player must shoot them all before they reach the bottom.
You can try building applications with your own interesting idea.


If you don’t like mathematics and games, you can try drawing shapes and other various patterns like pyramid using Python. I love doing it and trust me this will help you to expertise in loops as well.

What about this solid pyramid/triangle? It’s actually triangle but I love calling them pyramids.

[code]i=1
while i%3C10:
    if i==1:
        print( ' '*(10-i) + '*')
    else:
        print(' '*(10-i) + '*'*i + '*'*(i-1))
    i+=1 
 
         *
        ***
       *****
      *******
     *********
    ***********
   *************
  ***************
 *****************
[/code]What about empty pyramid? This is a very small change but it’s fun.

[code]i=1
while i%3C=10:
    if i==1:
        print(' '*(10-i) + '*')
    elif i==10:
        print('*'*(2*i-1))
    else:
        print(' '*(10-i) + '*' + ' '*(2*i-3) + '*')
    i+=1 

         *
        * *
       *   *
      *     *
     *       *
    *         *
   *           *
  *             *
 *               *
*******************
[/code]
If you don’t like these shapes, you can try basic search and sorting algorithms like linear and binary search, merge sort, quick sort etc etc.

These days programmers don’t care about it because there are in built Python libraries and functions to get this done but you will find it interesting when you start writing these algorithms yourself. It’s fun.


What about Matrix multiplication? It’s one of my favorite topics. Sample program,

[code]# 3x3 matrix
X = [[12,7,3],
    [4 ,5,6],
    [7 ,8,9]]

# 3x4 matrix
Y = [[5,8,1,2],
    [6,7,3,0],
    [4,5,9,1]]

# result is 3x4
result = [[0,0,0,0],
         [0,0,0,0],
         [0,0,0,0]]


for i in range(len(X)):
   for j in range(len(Y[0])):
       for k in range(len(Y)):
           result[i][j] += X[i][k] * Y[k][j]

for r in result:
   print(r)
[/code]You can try getting m*n matrix input from user and multiply with another x*n matrix and print the result.


There are few books as well which has very interesting projects which involves game and website building. Not sure about other books but I have read this one which has very interesting project work. This book has 2 parts - first one is to learn Python and then project work. Project work is really fun.

Hack someone else code, it’s fun way to learn Python.

When you reverse engineer someone else's code, testing each line to see how it works, you get a better understanding of the big picture. Thanks to tons of open source code, you can learn just about anything—and keep learning through the incremental-hacking cycle. Just remember to share your code back with the community if you improve on a program.

What about this one? Generating organic traffic via Google, it’s very basic program. However, there are many other hacks you need to do in order to successfully achieve this.

Just try not to burn out and to turn it into some boring chores: some frustration is ok (if not, it means you are doing it too easy), but if you feel too bored, then you have to change your path. Soon. Or even better: now!

I myself am currently more on the ""compete"" side, but the right mix is a subtle balance that each one of us has to find and recalibrate from time to time.

What can I do to make Python programming fun to learn?,"Create small projects to put the things you learnt to use.

You learned basics of Python - variables, if statements and loops?

Write a text adventure game! - You only need a few variables and if statements to make a fun text game. Put some creativity and humor into it and show it off to your friends or even make the game about them :)

When you know more about Python programming and maybe some objective-orientated programming you can start learning one of many Python packages and libraries that are mostly easy to learn and allow to create inresting projects even by beginners:

 * Tkinter/wxpython/kivy - These packages allow to create Graphical User Interfaces for your Python programs which makes it easier to share your programs with your friends and family if they are not programmers.
 * Pygame/Pyglet/Kivy - These are some of the game development libraries of Python. They will allow you to create more advanced games with graphics. You won't be able to make games likein Unity or Unreal engines but you can make a decent 2D game.
 * Bokeh/Plotly/Matplotlib - These bunch of tools is used for plotting and visualization. You can create some beautiful and interactive charts. And who doesn't love charts? I know I do.
 * BeautifulSoup/Scrapy/lxml - This is the type of libraries I used most for my projects. They allow you to crawl through websites and parse html and xml data to extract it from websites.
 * Flask/Eve/Django - These are Python web frameworks. They will allow you to develop full-blown websites.
 * And there thousands more of Python packages to explore (129200 according to PyPI)
Learning basics of some of these packages gives you a great basis to create really fun and even useful projects.

Here are some of the ideas for projects using these libraries:

 * Extract coordinates from wikipedia list of earthquakes/cities/terrorist attacks/any list, plot them on the map and put the map on the Flask website. You can add some charts along.
 * Create a video downloader GUI application to download videos from your favorite sites for offline use.
 * Create a Discord/Messanger bot to fetch data from web.
And there are countless more possibilities. I hope that gives you some idea how to make your Python learning experience fun, it most certainly made mine fun.

Here is my personal learning experience:

How do I Start Learning Python?

I started learning Python from Complete Python Tutorial by CodeClary (Available for Free) as it was the recommended course for beginners. You can also visit the CodeClary(.com) to start learning python form Beginners to Advanced in 3 weeks.

This course was recommended by one of my friend and I really found the course very useful and interesting yet simple for beginners like me.

What motivated me to start learning Python?

I fell in love with Python after reading a lot of answers on Quora about how people were doing wonderful things with Python.

 * Instagram Bot: Like/Comment/Follow Automation Script
 * Script to download favorite songs.
 * Built a system to receive live cricket score updates.
 * Easily create professional websites, games and much more.
All of this seemed very excited to me and I finally decided that I would love to learn Python.

Tips to Help you Learn Python as Quickly as Possible

Here are a few ways you might find the spare hours:

1. Set Your Alarm Clock for 30 Minutes Earlier

The best time you can set aside to learn Python each day is in the morning.

Biologically, your best, most productive time is around the first two hours of each day. You don’t want to sacrifice any sleep, but you may want to get to bed earlier so you can practice a bit before work.

It's a commitment, for sure. But, if you set aside your clothes the night before, have your coffee ready to go and already know what aspects of Python you are going to work on, it’s a bit easier. Tell yourself that you can’t look at your phone or emails until you dedicate 30 minutes toward learning Python and make it a habit!

The time it saves and the advancement in your career will be worth the extra effort. As an added benefit, you’ll feel extra healthy when you get a productive head start on your day.

You may even surprise yourself - lots of people who think they are just ‘not morning people’ find after getting enough sleep each night that it was only a matter of shifting the hours around and building some healthy habits.

It feels pretty cool to say, “I stayed up all night coding.”

But a lot of those times we overestimate our productivity - you don’t get nearly as much done or retain as much information when you’re tired. When you look at the numbers with fresh eyes, you can absorb what you learn much better!

2. Log Off Your Evening Netflix Habit

If you already wake up at 5 am to get to work each day, waking up earlier may not be the best option for you.

In that case, you might take the first 2 hours when you get home from work each day to learn Python. If you are overwhelmed with the idea of finding 2 hours between your commute, gym, dinnertime and downtime, spend a week really looking at how your spend your evenings.

Write down what you did each day this week – how much time did you spend binging Netflix? Did you waste a few hours on social media (be honest)? Did you get lost scrolling through Amazon? Can you prep your meals on Sunday to cut back on weeknight cooking?

Leave the Fortnite battle bus behind for one night and remember those reasons you wanted to learn Python to begin with.

Or, you can bookend your day with data science. After reserving your morning hours for your most important projects, you can review your work or participate in forums before bed to help your mastery.

3. Take Advantage of Quiet Saturday Mornings

We’ve seen that practicing every day is the best way to learn Python. For the students who have mastered data science principles the quickest, that includes some weekends.

It's important to be as consistent as possible, but sometimes life gets in the way. That’s what weekends are for. If you’re completely booked from 5 am to 6 pm every day, you can keep yourself on track by putting in extra hours on the weekend.

Plus, this is a great way to find uninterrupted time in a space you’ve dedicated just for learning python. Tie it to something rewarding — a walk through the park, a sandwich from your favorite coffee shop — to make your Python study time something that you look forward to!

One thing to keep in mind: studying two hours a day is far better than 10 hours in one day on the weekend. If you have other commitments during the week, even 10 minutes each morning will make a difference compared to only looking at Python materials once a week.

I got burned out after a year or so, and I asked myself the same questions, but continued pushing it for another few years. Then I quit and decided to reorient myself. I pursued other interests including sustainable urban farming, art school, and hobby software projects like games. 

Now almost 10 years later, I believe what changed after school was simply motivation, due to a reduction in my personal freedom and also the diversity of my daily activities and projects. In school, during any given week I could develop chat software, design a website for a friend, switch my laptop's Linux distro, create guitar effect algorithms... All while going to class and learning fascinating stuff about databases and music theory and program analysis. 

I tried to replicate this lifestyle at Google, by attending Tech Talks and participating in 20% projects, but it wasn't enough.

What are the best resources to start learning Python?,"I have been teaching myself programming and Python. Some resources I found helpful:

1. Learn Python The Hard Way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] is usually recommended enthusiastically, and I thought it was good. It very much puts the onus on you to investigate and be creative. This can seem daunting at first; I started with LPTHW, quit and did Codeacademy for a while (mostly because it provides instant gratification), and then came back to LPTHW and felt like I got quite a bit from it..
2. Codecademy's Python course is OK, but I really didn't like the IDE; oftentimes it would reject working code. Like I mentioned above, I came to this after starting – and stopping – LPTHW. It is fun and easy to make progress at Codecademy, but I don't think it's an optimal learning environment, especially if you haven't done any programming before. 
3. Think Python [ http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/ ] &  How To Think Like A Computer Scientist: Learning With Python (Interactive Edition) [ http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html ]
Think Python is published by O'Reilly but is also available free, direct from the author. I'm learning from this textbook now after having done (1) and (2), and feel like I'm learning quite a few new things, having important concepts reinforced, and getting an idea of some of the basic ideas of computer science. I've made a Memrise ""course"" to help me to remember all the vocabulary: Think Python vocabulary [ http://www.memrise.com/course/173951/think-python-vocabulary/ ].
One of the things that makes Think Python nice is that you do some work with graphics; that adds some spice to material that has become familiar.
The text of Think Python has also been used to develop the interactive textbook How to Think Like A Computer Scientist, which is pretty fantastic. You are able to do everything in the browser, and the course uses Python 3. I've done some work in it. If I'd found How to Think Like A Computer Scientist first, I probably would have only used it.

Hope that's helpful.

How do I learn to code?,"Don't just read the books. The best way to learn how to program is by doing it. It's easy to spend hours reading about syntax, but computer languages like human languages require you to use them in order to understand them. 

Try starting with simple projects. If you're going the HTML / CSS route, play with JavaScript and get a simple div to move around on the page when you click on something. Then work your way up to more complex ones. For instance, write a simple todo list with HTML form elements. You have to learn DOM manipulation to properly handle when the user interacts with the page. 

At Stanford, they teach beginning CS with games. Try building a hangman game using JS, or even just on the command prompt using Ruby or Python.

How do I learn Python by myself?,"One of the things that I found most frustrating when I was learning Python was how generic all the learning resources were. It seemed like every learning resource wanted me to spend 2 long, boring, months on Python syntax before I could even think about doing what interested me.

I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.

Lets take this code snippet for example :

[code]from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request): 
	return HttpResponse(""Hello, world. You're at the polls index."")
[/code]Experienced programmers will often throw snippets like the above at you. ""It's easy!"", they'll promise. But even a few seemingly simple lines of code can be incredibly confusing. For instance, why are some lines indented? What's [code ]django.http[/code]? Why are some things in parentheses? Understanding how everything fits together when you don't know much Python can be very hard.

The problem is that you need to understand the building blocks of the Python language to build anything interesting.Most tutorials assume that you need to learn all of Python syntax before you can start doing anything interesting. This is what leads to months spent just on syntax, when what you really want to be doing is analyzing data, or building a website, or creating an autonomous drone

Here are some tips to help you make the new concepts you are learning as a beginner programmer really stick:

1. Code Everyday : Consistency is very important when you are learning a new language. We recommend making a commitment to code every day. It may be hard to believe, but muscle memory plays a large part in programming. Committing to coding everyday will really help develop that muscle memory. Though it may seem daunting at first, consider starting small with 25 minutes everyday and working your way up from there.
2. Go Interactive : Whether you are learning about basic Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.) for the first time, or you are debugging an application, the interactive Python shell will be one of your best learning tools.
3. Build Something, Anything : For beginners, there are many small exercises that will really help you become confident with Python, as well as develop the muscle memory that we spoke about above. Once you have a solid grasp on basic data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, sets), object-oriented programming , and writing classes, it’s time to start building!What you build is not as important as how you build it. The journey of building is truly what will teach you the most. You can only learn so much from reading Real Python articles and courses. Most of your learning will come from using Python to build something. The problems you will solve will teach you a lot.There are many lists out there with ideas for beginner Python projects. Here are some ideas to get you started:
4. 
1. Number guessing game
2. Simple calculator app
3. Dice roll simulator

5. Contribute to Open Source : In the open-source model, software source code is available publicly, and anyone can collaborate. There are many Python libraries that are open-source projects and take contributions. Additionally, many companies publish open-source projects. This means you can work with code written and produced by the engineers working in these companies.
6. Take Breaks : When you are learning, it is important to step away and absorb the concepts.you work for 25 minutes, take a short break, and then repeat the process. Taking breaks is critical to having an effective study session, particularly when you are taking in a lot of new information.Breaks are especially important when you are debugging. If you hit a bug and can’t quite figure out what is going wrong, take a break. Step away from your computer, go for a walk .In programming, your code must follow the rules of a language and logic exactly, so even missing a quotation mark will break everything. Fresh eyes make a big difference.
Hope that helps :)

How do I learn Python?,"The easiest way to learn a programming language is to first learn the basics and then try to build something with it (learn by doing). And it's better if you are building something you are actually interested in rather than something out of a book because it will get you to think about the problem and be more meaningful. 

Python is easy to learn (not much syntax), easy to read (explicit vs implicit), has a big ecosystem (more packages/libraries), is taught at universities so it's easy to find good programmers to help, and is used by many large websites/companies (e.g., Quora is programmed in Python) so it's a good language to know.

What is the best way to learn Python from beginning to advanced?,"Rather than giving you boring steps of learning Python, I would like to share my personal journey about how I started learning Python and what motivated me to learn this language.

Also, I completed it within 3 weeks (daily 3-4 hours) and got my first job as a Python Programmer with a salary of INR 40,000 per month.

Here is my personal learning experience:

How do I Start Learning Python?

I started learning Python from Complete Python Tutorial by CodeClary (Available for Free) as it was the recommended course for beginners. You can also visit the CodeClary(.com) to start learning python form Beginners to Advanced in 3 weeks.

This course was recommended by one of my friend and I really found the course very useful and interesting yet simple for beginners like me.

What motivated me to start learning Python?

I fell in love with Python after reading a lot of answers on Quora about how people were doing wonderful things with Python.

 * Instagram Bot: Like/Comment/Follow Automation Script
 * Script to download favorite songs.
 * Built a system to receive live cricket score updates.
 * Easily create professional websites, games and much more.
All of this seemed very excited to me and I finally decided that I would love to learn Python.

Tips to Help you Learn Python as Quickly as Possible

Here are a few ways you might find the spare hours:

1. Set Your Alarm Clock for 30 Minutes Earlier

The best time you can set aside to learn Python each day is in the morning.

Biologically, your best, most productive time is around the first two hours of each day. You don’t want to sacrifice any sleep, but you may want to get to bed earlier so you can practice a bit before work.

It's a commitment, for sure. But, if you set aside your clothes the night before, have your coffee ready to go and already know what aspects of Python you are going to work on, it’s a bit easier. Tell yourself that you can’t look at your phone or emails until you dedicate 30 minutes toward learning Python and make it a habit!

The time it saves and the advancement in your career will be worth the extra effort. As an added benefit, you’ll feel extra healthy when you get a productive head start on your day.

You may even surprise yourself - lots of people who think they are just ‘not morning people’ find after getting enough sleep each night that it was only a matter of shifting the hours around and building some healthy habits.

It feels pretty cool to say, “I stayed up all night coding.”

But a lot of those times we overestimate our productivity - you don’t get nearly as much done or retain as much information when you’re tired. When you look at the numbers with fresh eyes, you can absorb what you learn much better!

2. Log Off Your Evening Netflix Habit

If you already wake up at 5 am to get to work each day, waking up earlier may not be the best option for you.

In that case, you might take the first 2 hours when you get home from work each day to learn Python. If you are overwhelmed with the idea of finding 2 hours between your commute, gym, dinnertime and downtime, spend a week really looking at how your spend your evenings.

Write down what you did each day this week – how much time did you spend binging Netflix? Did you waste a few hours on social media (be honest)? Did you get lost scrolling through Amazon? Can you prep your meals on Sunday to cut back on weeknight cooking?

Leave the Fortnite battle bus behind for one night and remember those reasons you wanted to learn Python to begin with.

Or, you can bookend your day with data science. After reserving your morning hours for your most important projects, you can review your work or participate in forums before bed to help your mastery.

3. Take Advantage of Quiet Saturday Mornings

We’ve seen that practicing every day is the best way to learn Python. For the students who have mastered data science principles the quickest, that includes some weekends.

It's important to be as consistent as possible, but sometimes life gets in the way. That’s what weekends are for. If you’re completely booked from 5 am to 6 pm every day, you can keep yourself on track by putting in extra hours on the weekend.

Plus, this is a great way to find uninterrupted time in a space you’ve dedicated just for learning python. Tie it to something rewarding — a walk through the park, a sandwich from your favorite coffee shop — to make your Python study time something that you look forward to!

One thing to keep in mind: studying two hours a day is far better than 10 hours in one day on the weekend. If you have other commitments during the week, even 10 minutes each morning will make a difference compared to only looking at Python materials once a week.

4. Join A Community of Python Programmers

Joining a community of Python developers will help you stay on track toward your goal to learn Python.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Python-from-a-beginner-level-and-then-move-to-advanced?top_ans=197549228,2020-02-12T10:11:52.403613+00:00,,177,Anonymous,
How do I learn Python?,"The most important question to answer first is why do I want to learn python? Answering this will guide what you use to learn and how you learn.

Starting with a very generic list of resources to learn python when you eventually want to make websites (for example), will not only reduce your motivation, it will also make it much harder to apply the knowledge you gain.  I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.

When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.

1.  Find what motivates you

Finding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.

Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.

Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.

Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:
 * Websites
 * Mobile apps
 * Games
 * Data science/Machine learning

2.  Learn some basic python syntax

Unless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.

For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.

Some resources that can help you:

 * Codecademy [ http://www.codecademy.com ] -- does a good job of teaching basic syntax.
 * Learn python the hard way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] -- a book that teaches a lot of python concepts.

 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] -- this is my startup.  It's focused on teaching python for data science, but it teaches all the basic syntax also.
 * The Python Tutorial [ https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ ] -- the tutorial on the main python site.

I can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.

3.  Make structured projects in your chosen area

Unless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.

When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:

Games
 * Codecademy  [ http://www.codecademy.com- ]-- walks you through making a couple of simple games.
 * Pygame tutorials [ http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials ] -- pygame (the python library for making games) has a good list of tutorials
 * Making games with pygame [ http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982106017 ] -- this book looks like a great way to learn python by making games

Websites
 * Flask tutorial [ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/ ] -- the official flask (simple python web framework) tutorial.
 * Bottle tutorial [ http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html ] -- Bottle (even simpler web framework for python) tutorial. 

 * How To Tango With Django 1.7 [ http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/ ] -- a guide to using django (more complex python web framework)
Mobile apps
 * Kivy guide [ http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html-- ] -- Kivy is the tool that lets you make mobile apps with python.  They have a guide on how to get started.
Data science
 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] --  Teaches you python and data science interactively.  You analyze a series of interesting datasets ranging from CIA documents to NBA player stats.
 * Scikit-learn documentation [ http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html ] -- Scikit-learn (the main machine learning library for python) has some great documentation and tutorials.
 * Python for Data Analysis [ http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do ] -- written by the author of a major python data analysis library (pandas), it's a good introduction to analyzing data in python.

4.  Work on projects on your own

Once you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.

Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.

Some ideas:
 *  Extend the projects you were working on previously, and add more functionality.
 * Go to python meetups in your area, and find people who are working on interesting projects.
 * Find open source packages to contribute to.
 * See if any local nonprofits are looking for volunteer developers.
 * Find projects other people have made, and see if you can extend or adapt them.
My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.

The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.

5.  Keep working on harder projects

Keep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.

Here are some ideas for when that time comes:
 * Try teaching a novice how to do your current project.
 * Try load testing your website -- can you scale it up?
 * Can you make your program run faster?

Going forward

At the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it. 

You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.

Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Python-from-a-beginner-level-and-then-move-to-advanced?top_ans=13841814,2015-07-07T13:40:55.951227+00:00,,3046,Vik Paruchuri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vik-Paruchuri
How do I learn Python from a beginner level and then move to advanced?,"One should always strive to learn fundamentals of programming thoroughly, than trying to master a language. Learning the syntax and other niceties of language won't make one a master of that language, only practice will. A good programmer uses language as a tool to accomplish tasks.

Here is my list if you need to become a good programmer with Python as your language of choice. 

Follow this order for rigorous course on learning Python thoroughly.

1. Learn fundamentals of programming - How to Think Like a Computer Scientist [ http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/ ].
2. Learn Data structures and algorithms - Data Structures and Algorithms in Python [ http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002510.html ].
3. Learn Object oriented analysis and design - Python 3 Object Oriented Programming [ http://www.amazon.in/Python-3-Object-Oriented-Programming/dp/1849511268 ].
4. Dive deep into internals of Python - Learning Python 5ed [ http://www.amazon.in/Learning-Python-5ed-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730 ].
5. Mastering Object oriented programming - Mastering Object-oriented Python [ https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-object-oriented-python ].
6. Learning design patterns - Mastering Python Design Patterns [ https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-python-design-patterns ].

By the end, you will be famished but you will have a very solid base to understand and design code for complex systems. To get more hands on experience, start with any popular open source project and delve into the source code. Don't start with the master branch of the codebase, start the version 1 tag of the codebase and progress through the next version tags and check for changelog and move on. 

E.g mitsuhiko/flask [ https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tree/0.1 ]

Finally you will have a solid understanding of Python as well as how objects communicate behaviors. 

Mastery is different beast, which you will be able to tame slowly by crafting clean and maintainable code.

How do I go from a beginner python developer to intermediate then advanced?,"Thanks for A2A.

Keeping it simple, practice practice and practice.

Being a beginner is easiest, if you have done other language you are already here. Start with online tutorials & videos. Experiment with simplest of problems that uses string manipulation, arithmetic operations and function calls. Personal suggestion: Don’t use IDE (PyCharm, etc..) during this time, I started with Sublime Text and simple code highlighter only. As for now don’t bother with Py2.7, use Py3 it is the future.

For intermediate, explore python. By explore I mean, play with structural programming and move to OOP. Make a habit of consulting pydoc first (online docs and pydoc terminal command). Implement most used/popular data structure and design patterns, at the same time study which type of problem could that pattern be most useful for. Study how different libraries (simpler ones you used in beginner phase) are developed. Try to improve scripts you wrote during beginner phase using new found skills, make is functional or even implement it with class. Work with multiple files, split you single long scripts in different classes, use your class as libraries. Play with virtualenv. Get yourself acknowledged (just know about these, not necessarily development) with most powerful python libraries (Flask/Django for Web, NumPy for Computational, pandas for Data Manipulation, Keras/ScikitLearn for AI, NLTK for NLP, MatPlotLib for Visualization,… you got the gist.) Finally, find and solve online programming challenges.

Now advanced for me is specific, ie, where you want to take your python expertise. Overall python pro is too vague and a lot to grasp. For most part, intermediate level will do. If you have made your mind about where your next step lies, may it be Web, Data, AI or stuff, you know enough which you need to learn in deep.

For example you wish to move toward Web development, you need to have knowledge of web technologies and how they work. Then learn how those are implemented in python or any of its framework. Django and its security vs Flask and its simplicity, what your web app needs more. Jinja templates is another must. Frontend is another beast. One can never be JUST backend developer, you should at least know your way around JS, CSS & HTML. Also get yourself acquainted about different web architecture like MVC.

On other hand, you choose python for AI and stuff; techs mentioned in above paragraph might be useless for you. Here one have to have extensive knowledge of Stats & Probability. Mathematics is heart of AI. Start getting deep on NumPy, pandas, Scikitlearn,… Rather than just using libraries, first try to understand it. If you can develop a version of it on your own it helps you to get grasp on underlying calculation processes. Solve problems from kaggle, study others’ solution and identify your weak point. Check for math problems & solutions, code the solution in python (without libraries).

Last one, Python Guru (just a term I use). They are ones who develop and support python. Derive new libraries, improve/optimize existing codes. To be here, learning or even being advance python dev is just a tip of hidden iceberg inside vast concept of programming, mathematics & computational theories. Anyway we are not talking about this, move on.

In short, intermediate is hardest to master. By the time you are in upper part of intermediate, you can tackle almost any problem using python. Before stepping to advance libraries on your desired path, I suggest you to learn ins-and-outs of general python convention.

Lastly, “Language is just a tool to develop. Data structure and algorithm should be your main concern.” Code can be found anywhere once you know what and how to tackle the problem.

Let's remove the word Python and replace it by any programming language since that is true for all languages. Personally I like to start with some beginners guide to get an idea of the language syntax. I assume you already did that. After that I usually look for a tutorial. In case of Python a huge bunch should be available online. As soon as I feel comfortable I start working on a smaller project. If I face problems I really want to understand them and solve them in a clean way. No dirty hacks that work. Iterate on that. Start bigger and more advanced projects and so on. Don't forget about testing and learn about good design patterns. Which patterns often depend on the app itself, but any can be used in different concerns.

2. Learn the most popular libraries, why they were made, how they work. (I.e: Flask, Django, requests)
3. Try writing concurrent code, learn about threads, process, how they work, their weakness in Python.
4. Learn about sockets, network libraries, async features.
5. Learn a little about scipy and numpy.
6. Learn about interpreters, how they work, why there are so many different implementations of Python. (Python is written in English not C as many state, the most common implementation is a C based interpreter). This is a very important concept.
7. Learn about Python ecosystem. Please do not be a hipster writing code in the notepad, at least not yet. Learn to use PyCharm. Learn about PEP8. Learn about PIP, setuptools, virtualenv.
8. Learn about Python production brothers. Docker containers. UWSGI. Gunicorn. NGINX. All the stuff.
9. Learn tips and tricks from Google. Lambda functions. Decorators, descriptors, iterators, generators, metaclasses (Thanks Adrian Carpenter [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Adrian-Carpenter ]!). One liners like: ""python -m http.server"".

What is the best way to learn Python from beginning to advanced?,"There're two types of people before learning any language:

1. Changing their tool/language -
 * Learning python is not that hard if you have a prior knowledge of DS Algo and oops. And if you know these things, that means you already know some other programming language, which means you just have to learn new syntaxes, which is surely very easy and precise (in case of python) to learn.
 * After learning this, if you want to learn python for some project building purposes like ML then, you just need to learn ML concepts and Algorithms as you've already learned syntaxes and basic DS Algo. And ML is a thing which really depends on a person, if you're good in maths and have interest in this field then this path is for you, otherwise you can feel bored doing this.
2. First time learners (no prior knowledge of DS Algo) -

 * If you're a first time learner, then it is necessary to learn DS Algo and it's not at all easy unless you have a good mentor.
 * If you ask me, then I'll recommend Coding Ninjas’ Ds Algo with python course. I've taken this course and Ankush sir takes care of basics of python as well as DS Algo (in fact DS Algo is the center point). After doing this course, you have a good knowledge of DS Algo and as you've done this in python then you know syntaxes and able to solve problems in python.
 * Now comes to the project building part, so now as you're comfortable with python you can go for ML or if you don't want to then you can use python in Competitive coding as this course really makes you ready for implementing DS Algo knowledge in questions.
These are two basic points to master python (syntax and tricks on tips & able to make project in any python related technology). I think I've told you enough about these points, so now i want to justify why I've recommended Coding Ninjas?

So basically, the mentor (Ankush sir) is the highlight that you should go for this. Apart from this, specially if you're a beginner then some features will really help you to master python like:

1. TA’s support - they help ypu 24x7 to Cleer your doubt, which makes your base stronger.
2. Assignments and Problems - this helps in self evaluation and have fixed time line which helps in completing the course in a same pase.
3. Placement Assistance - if an organisation has a tie up with companies like Microsoft and Google and also assist you to placements then you can think the level of content they provide. As the main goal to learn all these is a good placement, so why don't you learn from a place which knows exactly what these companies asks for?
I hope I've cleared your doubts. Best of luck buddy!",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Python-from-a-beginner-level-and-then-move-to-advanced?top_ans=247519012,2020-11-03T05:37:18.778146+00:00,,4,Kirti Sharma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Kirti-Sharma-1268
What is the best way to learn Python from beginning to advanced?,"Best Way to Start Learning Python

The best way to learn Python is to implement whatever you read. Just open your laptop, install Python, and start coding. You can learn as you go!

But, before you do that, here are some tips to make it easy for you –

 * If you are a non-programmer, have a little extra patience. You will get there for sure. Python is the easiest way to get into programming.
 * Think of your small application and make your learning around it. Preferably build a simple website using Django. For example, browsing through the list of phones and buying one, purchasing your weekly grocery online, managing employee details, and more. If you just read and don’t try what you read, you will not be able to grasp or remember the concepts.
 * If you get an error, that means you are going in the right direction. If you make a lot of mistakes, that’s great. Every error should make you excited and eager to find the solution. The best learning is through errors and exceptions.
 * Take a reputed online course to kickstart your Python journey. From Zero to Hero in Python is one of the best courses on the internet to start learning Python.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvhQhj4n6b8
 * Learn the syntax along the way. Don’t spend too much time on learning the syntax alone. Have a project set up with an IDE like PyCharm, start coding. You will get to know the syntax as you write more code.
 * Start with a simple project and enhance the functionality as you code. Include more complex concepts as you can develop code.

How do I learn Python?,"The most important question to answer first is why do I want to learn python? Answering this will guide what you use to learn and how you learn.

Starting with a very generic list of resources to learn python when you eventually want to make websites (for example), will not only reduce your motivation, it will also make it much harder to apply the knowledge you gain.  I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.

When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.

1.  Find what motivates you

Finding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.

Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.

Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.

Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:
 * Websites
 * Mobile apps
 * Games
 * Data science/Machine learning

2.  Learn some basic python syntax

Unless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.

For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.

Some resources that can help you:

 * Codecademy [ http://www.codecademy.com ] -- does a good job of teaching basic syntax.
 * Learn python the hard way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] -- a book that teaches a lot of python concepts.

 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] -- this is my startup.  It's focused on teaching python for data science, but it teaches all the basic syntax also.
 * The Python Tutorial [ https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ ] -- the tutorial on the main python site.

I can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.

3.  Make structured projects in your chosen area

Unless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.

When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:

Games
 * Codecademy  [ http://www.codecademy.com- ]-- walks you through making a couple of simple games.
 * Pygame tutorials [ http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials ] -- pygame (the python library for making games) has a good list of tutorials
 * Making games with pygame [ http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982106017 ] -- this book looks like a great way to learn python by making games

Websites
 * Flask tutorial [ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/ ] -- the official flask (simple python web framework) tutorial.
 * Bottle tutorial [ http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html ] -- Bottle (even simpler web framework for python) tutorial. 

 * How To Tango With Django 1.7 [ http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/ ] -- a guide to using django (more complex python web framework)
Mobile apps
 * Kivy guide [ http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html-- ] -- Kivy is the tool that lets you make mobile apps with python.  They have a guide on how to get started.
Data science
 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] --  Teaches you python and data science interactively.  You analyze a series of interesting datasets ranging from CIA documents to NBA player stats.
 * Scikit-learn documentation [ http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html ] -- Scikit-learn (the main machine learning library for python) has some great documentation and tutorials.
 * Python for Data Analysis [ http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do ] -- written by the author of a major python data analysis library (pandas), it's a good introduction to analyzing data in python.

4.  Work on projects on your own

Once you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.

Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.

Some ideas:
 *  Extend the projects you were working on previously, and add more functionality.
 * Go to python meetups in your area, and find people who are working on interesting projects.
 * Find open source packages to contribute to.
 * See if any local nonprofits are looking for volunteer developers.
 * Find projects other people have made, and see if you can extend or adapt them.
My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.

The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.

5.  Keep working on harder projects

Keep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.

Here are some ideas for when that time comes:
 * Try teaching a novice how to do your current project.
 * Try load testing your website -- can you scale it up?
 * Can you make your program run faster?

Going forward

At the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it. 

You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.

Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Python-3?top_ans=13841814,2015-07-07T13:40:55.951227+00:00,,3046,Vik Paruchuri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vik-Paruchuri

How do I learn Python?,"We know that Python is used for various purposes. Some of them are AI and machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, a framework for website development, building desktop applications and many more.

Everyone has a different purpose for learning Python. So, the way you learn should also be according to your objective. However, some common ways can help you learn the language effectively and efficiently. Everything requires a strategy.

Here are some strategies for you to learn Python.

1. Code Everyday

Do you want to master Python programming? Then you have to practice coding every day. Consistency is the key to perfection. You need to spend a minimum of 30 minutes a day to understand the working of Python. You can use websites like Python Geeks [ https://pythongeeks.org/category/python-projects/ ] and Project Gurukul [ https://projectgurukul.org/ ] that provide Python codes and teach you programs.

In the starting phase, you may make many mistakes, and your code might have bugs. Constantly finding bugs means the concepts are not clear to you. When you keep making the same mistake, you can correct yourself and thoroughly understand the concepts and prevent yourself from making the same mistakes.

2. Practice Writing Code

Just typing the code on the screen is not enough. You need to be able to write it out anywhere. Typing is easier than writing as the software shows whether your code is right or wrong. However, when you are writing it on paper, you have no idea if your code will work or not. During interviews, the interviewees are asked to write code on a whiteboard. You have not mastered Python if you cannot write the 'right code' using a pen and paper Python.

3. Bug Hunting

The bug hunting process means finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program. Coding and bug hunting go hand in hand. When there is code, there is always a bug. Even the most brilliant coders hit bugs while writing code. All you can do is keep identifying bugs and debugging. The more bugs you hit, the fewer mistakes you will make in the future.

4. Pair Programming

Pair programming is a software development process where two programmers work together at one workstation. One programmer is the driver, while the other is an observer or a navigator. The driver writes the code while the navigator reviews each line of code as and when the driver writes it. It means you have a fresh pair of eyes to help you find your mistakes. It is an effective process that saves time and is a great way for you to learn.

5. Open Source Projects

Open source projects in Python are a great way to learn how to code. They allow you to work on real-world problems and collaborate with other developers. Also, Python is open-source software. It means you can use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Some of the best open source projects for you to work on in Python include:

 * Scikit-learn: A Python library for Machine Learning
 * TensorFlow: A software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs
 * Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on
Hope this Helps!! Happy Learning ;)

How long it takes to learn Python

It depends upon that how much effort you do but I would say, if you spend 2+ hours in a day daily, after 3 months, you will be able to write basic python program that doesn't give you a job. In order to get a job, you need to specialise in one area like web applications, machine learning etc.

For example if you want to become a web developer you should also learn HTML, CSS, some JavaScript and Django which is the popular Python framework for building web applications. To learn these things would take you another 6 months. So in total you need 10 - 13 Months to become a job ready as a junior developer. So let's start

First, Basic of Python

 * Variables
 * Recieving inputs
 * Type conversation
 * Strings
 * Formatted strings
 * String methods
 * Arithmetic Operations
 * Maths functions
 * If else
 * Logical operators
 * Comparison Operators
 * While loops
 * For loops
 * Nested loops
 * Lists
 * 2D lists
 * List methods
 * Tuples
 * Unpacking
 * Dictionaries
 * Parameter
 * Keywords argument
 * Comments
 * Classes and Objects
 * Inheritance
 * Constructor
 * Modules
 * Packages, etc.
From above you can make a some simple Programs and can Implement Data structures like Stack, Queue, Linked-list, sorting, searching, factorial, tik-tak-toe without graphics, etc.

Second, choose your specialise area

 * Django for web developer
 * Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Numpy for machine learning
 * Sci-pi, pandas etc for Data science
 * Pygame etc for game development etc.
Third, learn your favourite library. As of now you will be able to get a job as a junior software developer.

What's the secret to learning how to code faster?,"Never repeat a mistake. That’s as fast as you’ll get.

Quick example: you name your variables a, b and c. You learn that it is important to name them more descriptively. You rename them to firstName, surname and dateOfBirth.

You never name anything a, b, c again.

What’s hard about this is how many poor practices there are. You inevitably will repeat mistakes through lack of knowledge.

What are the steps for learning python?,"Start with your goal. Why do you want to learn Python [ https://writeabout.tech/programming/learning-to-create-python-multi-threaded-and-multi-process/ ]? Are you looking for the best way to learn Python because you want to change careers? Or because you have an idea for a great app that you want to design yourself? Do you want to add coding to your resume to get a job in an industry that hires people with programming skills? Identifying your motivation gives you focus. It can also help narrow down the best resources to achieve your goals. For example, if you’re mainly interested in web development, you might not learn as much from a course about using Python for data analysis.

After you’ve identified your goals, ask: What’s your learning style?Did you thrive in the structured format of school? Or do you love reading books to teach yourself skills on your own? Do you learn best when you interact with other students or by yourself? Also, consider whether you prefer a teaching method that walks you through everything step-by-step or one that offers a more challenging approach. Knowing your learning style can help you find the types of programs that will help you learn Python.

Now ask yourself: What’s your coding level? Do you already know another programming language, or are you completely new to coding? The best way to learn Python varies depending on your skill level. If you’re completely new, you might want to start with an introductory course or beginner’s book. If you already know Java or C++ and you want to add Python to your list, you can start with a more advanced option. You might also prefer tutorials or structured projects to an online course format.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Python-3?top_ans=156369618,2019-07-25T14:10:29.132830+00:00,,30,Calvin K James,https://www.quora.com/profile/Calvin-K-James
How do I learn Python by myself?,"One of the things that I found most frustrating when I was learning Python was how generic all the learning resources were. It seemed like every learning resource wanted me to spend 2 long, boring, months on Python syntax before I could even think about doing what interested me.

I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.

Lets take this code snippet for example :

[code]from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request): 
	return HttpResponse(""Hello, world. You're at the polls index."")
[/code]Experienced programmers will often throw snippets like the above at you. ""It's easy!"", they'll promise. But even a few seemingly simple lines of code can be incredibly confusing. For instance, why are some lines indented? What's [code ]django.http[/code]? Why are some things in parentheses? Understanding how everything fits together when you don't know much Python can be very hard.

The problem is that you need to understand the building blocks of the Python language to build anything interesting.Most tutorials assume that you need to learn all of Python syntax before you can start doing anything interesting. This is what leads to months spent just on syntax, when what you really want to be doing is analyzing data, or building a website, or creating an autonomous drone

Here are some tips to help you make the new concepts you are learning as a beginner programmer really stick:

1. Code Everyday : Consistency is very important when you are learning a new language. We recommend making a commitment to code every day. It may be hard to believe, but muscle memory plays a large part in programming. Committing to coding everyday will really help develop that muscle memory. Though it may seem daunting at first, consider starting small with 25 minutes everyday and working your way up from there.
2. Go Interactive : Whether you are learning about basic Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.) for the first time, or you are debugging an application, the interactive Python shell will be one of your best learning tools.
3. Build Something, Anything : For beginners, there are many small exercises that will really help you become confident with Python, as well as develop the muscle memory that we spoke about above. Once you have a solid grasp on basic data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, sets), object-oriented programming , and writing classes, it’s time to start building!What you build is not as important as how you build it. The journey of building is truly what will teach you the most. You can only learn so much from reading Real Python articles and courses. Most of your learning will come from using Python to build something. The problems you will solve will teach you a lot.There are many lists out there with ideas for beginner Python projects. Here are some ideas to get you started:
4. 
1. Number guessing game
2. Simple calculator app
3. Dice roll simulator

5. Contribute to Open Source : In the open-source model, software source code is available publicly, and anyone can collaborate. There are many Python libraries that are open-source projects and take contributions. Additionally, many companies publish open-source projects. This means you can work with code written and produced by the engineers working in these companies.
6. Take Breaks : When you are learning, it is important to step away and absorb the concepts.you work for 25 minutes, take a short break, and then repeat the process. Taking breaks is critical to having an effective study session, particularly when you are taking in a lot of new information.Breaks are especially important when you are debugging. If you hit a bug and can’t quite figure out what is going wrong, take a break. Step away from your computer, go for a walk .In programming, your code must follow the rules of a language and logic exactly, so even missing a quotation mark will break everything. Fresh eyes make a big difference.
Hope that helps :)

What are the best resources to start learning Python?,"I have been teaching myself programming and Python. Some resources I found helpful:

1. Learn Python The Hard Way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] is usually recommended enthusiastically, and I thought it was good. It very much puts the onus on you to investigate and be creative. This can seem daunting at first; I started with LPTHW, quit and did Codeacademy for a while (mostly because it provides instant gratification), and then came back to LPTHW and felt like I got quite a bit from it..
2. Codecademy's Python course is OK, but I really didn't like the IDE; oftentimes it would reject working code. Like I mentioned above, I came to this after starting – and stopping – LPTHW. It is fun and easy to make progress at Codecademy, but I don't think it's an optimal learning environment, especially if you haven't done any programming before. 
3. Think Python [ http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/ ] &  How To Think Like A Computer Scientist: Learning With Python (Interactive Edition) [ http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html ]
Think Python is published by O'Reilly but is also available free, direct from the author. I'm learning from this textbook now after having done (1) and (2), and feel like I'm learning quite a few new things, having important concepts reinforced, and getting an idea of some of the basic ideas of computer science. I've made a Memrise ""course"" to help me to remember all the vocabulary: Think Python vocabulary [ http://www.memrise.com/course/173951/think-python-vocabulary/ ].
One of the things that makes Think Python nice is that you do some work with graphics; that adds some spice to material that has become familiar.
The text of Think Python has also been used to develop the interactive textbook How to Think Like A Computer Scientist, which is pretty fantastic. You are able to do everything in the browser, and the course uses Python 3. I've done some work in it. If I'd found How to Think Like A Computer Scientist first, I probably would have only used it.

Hope that's helpful.

Tips to Help you Learn Python as Quickly as Possible

Here are a few ways you might find the spare hours:

1. Set Your Alarm Clock for 30 Minutes Earlier

The best time you can set aside to learn Python each day is in the morning.

Biologically, your best, most productive time is around the first two hours of each day. You don’t want to sacrifice any sleep, but you may want to get to bed earlier so you can practice a bit before work.

It's a commitment, for sure. But, if you set aside your clothes the night before, have your coffee ready to go and already know what aspects of Python you are going to work on, it’s a bit easier. Tell yourself that you can’t look at your phone or emails until you dedicate 30 minutes toward learning Python and make it a habit!

The time it saves and the advancement in your career will be worth the extra effort. As an added benefit, you’ll feel extra healthy when you get a productive head start on your day.

You may even surprise yourself - lots of people who think they are just ‘not morning people’ find after getting enough sleep each night that it was only a matter of shifting the hours around and building some healthy habits.

It feels pretty cool to say, “I stayed up all night coding.”

But a lot of those times we overestimate our productivity - you don’t get nearly as much done or retain as much information when you’re tired. When you look at the numbers with fresh eyes, you can absorb what you learn much better!

2. Log Off Your Evening Netflix Habit

If you already wake up at 5 am to get to work each day, waking up earlier may not be the best option for you.

In that case, you might take the first 2 hours when you get home from work each day to learn Python. If you are overwhelmed with the idea of finding 2 hours between your commute, gym, dinnertime and downtime, spend a week really looking at how your spend your evenings.

Write down what you did each day this week – how much time did you spend binging Netflix? Did you waste a few hours on social media (be honest)? Did you get lost scrolling through Amazon? Can you prep your meals on Sunday to cut back on weeknight cooking?

Leave the Fortnite battle bus behind for one night and remember those reasons you wanted to learn Python to begin with.

Or, you can bookend your day with data science. After reserving your morning hours for your most important projects, you can review your work or participate in forums before bed to help your mastery.

3. Take Advantage of Quiet Saturday Mornings

We’ve seen that practicing every day is the best way to learn Python. For the students who have mastered data science principles the quickest, that includes some weekends.

It's important to be as consistent as possible, but sometimes life gets in the way. That’s what weekends are for. If you’re completely booked from 5 am to 6 pm every day, you can keep yourself on track by putting in extra hours on the weekend.

Plus, this is a great way to find uninterrupted time in a space you’ve dedicated just for learning python. Tie it to something rewarding — a walk through the park, a sandwich from your favorite coffee shop — to make your Python study time something that you look forward to!

One thing to keep in mind: studying two hours a day is far better than 10 hours in one day on the weekend. If you have other commitments during the week, even 10 minutes each morning will make a difference compared to only looking at Python materials once a week.

4. Join A Community of Python Programmers

Joining a community of Python developers will help you stay on track toward your goal to learn Python.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Python-3?top_ans=197549228,2020-02-12T10:11:52.403613+00:00,,177,Anonymous,
How do I learn Python?,"There are several ways of learning Python in general for the people who are just a beginner to the aforesaid language. However, around 80% of the learning material available on the internet is generic and cannot provide complete in-depth knowledge to those who don’t know the ABC of the language. Nevertheless, the remaining 20% are doing their best to provide the correct and technical guidance to the developers. You can find e-books, video tutorials, and illustrations to simplify the whole learning process.

Learning Python is not a very hectic process and you can in minimum time learn the programming language in a span of 3 to 4 months. However, that is basic python if you are willing to become a professional Python developer and seeking monetization of your skills then you need to specialize in any of the areas like Machine Learning, AI, etc. Hence we have compiled the best resources helpful in studying the language.

How do I Study Python?

Learning Python is not a difficult job but specializing in any of its branches is but you can begin your journey with these steps:

Start with Basics

Always start your basics with video tutorials offered by companies like Google, Python, or the most recent and successful course Python Learning Program by Testbook. You can also consider reading books developed by trained Python coders and developers to brush up on your basic knowledge. Try to master the Python Syntax as much as you can because a stronger foundation provides a perfect and professional result.

Write basic Python Codes

Once your basics are clear and you get a hold of how this language works you can begin with writing Python Codes. This has to be mastered by intense practice and perseverance. You can start with writing codes for small games, applications, web pages to perfect your skill.

Join a Professional Specialization Course

Clearing just the basics of any programming language won’t be helpful if you are looking for a full-time career in the same field. Similarly, for Python, you need to opt for a specialization course i.e. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc, However, it is not possible to learn these easily and you need to get admission to any technical schools to pursue the same.

Take-up Personal Projects

Now that you have completed your specialization program you can now opt for writing Python codes for high-end projects. Just remember that Python is a programming language and there are updates every now and then. The more you work and practice the more your skill will be perfect with time.

Are you seeking more information related to Python Syntax we recommend you to check out the Python Learning Course launched by Testbook under its Testbook Select Initiative.

How do I learn Python?,"The most important question to answer first is why do I want to learn python? Answering this will guide what you use to learn and how you learn.

Starting with a very generic list of resources to learn python when you eventually want to make websites (for example), will not only reduce your motivation, it will also make it much harder to apply the knowledge you gain.  I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.

When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.

1.  Find what motivates you

Finding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.

Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.

Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.

Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:
 * Websites
 * Mobile apps
 * Games
 * Data science/Machine learning

2.  Learn some basic python syntax

Unless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.

For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.

Some resources that can help you:

 * Codecademy [ http://www.codecademy.com ] -- does a good job of teaching basic syntax.
 * Learn python the hard way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] -- a book that teaches a lot of python concepts.

 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] -- this is my startup.  It's focused on teaching python for data science, but it teaches all the basic syntax also.
 * The Python Tutorial [ https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ ] -- the tutorial on the main python site.

I can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.

3.  Make structured projects in your chosen area

Unless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.

When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:

Games
 * Codecademy  [ http://www.codecademy.com- ]-- walks you through making a couple of simple games.
 * Pygame tutorials [ http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials ] -- pygame (the python library for making games) has a good list of tutorials
 * Making games with pygame [ http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982106017 ] -- this book looks like a great way to learn python by making games

Websites
 * Flask tutorial [ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/ ] -- the official flask (simple python web framework) tutorial.
 * Bottle tutorial [ http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html ] -- Bottle (even simpler web framework for python) tutorial. 

 * How To Tango With Django 1.7 [ http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/ ] -- a guide to using django (more complex python web framework)
Mobile apps
 * Kivy guide [ http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html-- ] -- Kivy is the tool that lets you make mobile apps with python.  They have a guide on how to get started.
Data science
 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] --  Teaches you python and data science interactively.  You analyze a series of interesting datasets ranging from CIA documents to NBA player stats.
 * Scikit-learn documentation [ http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html ] -- Scikit-learn (the main machine learning library for python) has some great documentation and tutorials.
 * Python for Data Analysis [ http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do ] -- written by the author of a major python data analysis library (pandas), it's a good introduction to analyzing data in python.

4.  Work on projects on your own

Once you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.

Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.

Some ideas:
 *  Extend the projects you were working on previously, and add more functionality.
 * Go to python meetups in your area, and find people who are working on interesting projects.
 * Find open source packages to contribute to.
 * See if any local nonprofits are looking for volunteer developers.
 * Find projects other people have made, and see if you can extend or adapt them.
My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.

The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.

5.  Keep working on harder projects

Keep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.

Here are some ideas for when that time comes:
 * Try teaching a novice how to do your current project.
 * Try load testing your website -- can you scale it up?
 * Can you make your program run faster?

Going forward

At the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it. 

You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.

Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-start-programming-to-learn-python-along-the-way?top_ans=13841814,2015-07-07T13:40:55.951227+00:00,,3046,Vik Paruchuri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vik-Paruchuri

How can I learn Python in 1 month?,"Well, the answer is damn Yes.

Yes, you can learn Python within one month. But you have to read me carefully. There are a few steps you have to follow during this 1 month. So, here we go.

Step 1: Don't go for any tutorial on the internet.

Why I'm saying is that,


%3E You are the only Guru of yourself to get things very fast.
Buy a book or collect from anywhere of Python 3. Yes, I'll repeat, go for Python 3. Please don't go for Python 2.

I'll recommend you to take learn Python the Hard Way [ https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html ] book as your guide. This is one of the best books in Python for beginners like you.

Step 2: Download an app DataCamp - Learn R, Python & SQL - Apps on Google Play [ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datacamp ] from play store( If you are an Android user) or DataCamp - Learn R & Python on the App Store [ https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/datacamp-learn-r-python/id1263413087 ] from App store (If you are a Richie Rich)

And keep doing practice on hand when you'll be free.

Step 3: Stop watching some useless video and start watching some Python stuff on YouTube.

And, that's it. After a month you'll see yourself as a Python programmer.

You've taken a great step, my dear mate. Go for it, because Python will tell you what you want to be after one month.

How do I learn Python Programming the most effective way?,"
%3E How can someone learn Python programming quickly and effectively?
First of all ask yourself that why do you want to learn Python? What is the purpose? What motivates you to learn it?

Some might be wanting to learn Python for creating websites and others might be learning it to create apps. When I started learning Python my only motive was to create different kinds of tools and automate my works,then I moved towards creating minimal games and websites.

Once you get the motive it will help you keep going!

Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.



%3E How to learn Python effectively and quickly?
 * First things first : Learn basic syntax. Go through the some best books or get in touch with some online resources. Python basic syntax are not that hard to learn. You can even master the basic Python syntax in a week or a month, It all depends on YOU!
 * PRACTICE!
 * Packages : Problem with most of the Python beginners is that they skip this step so once you get done with the basics, you can select some packages of your choice according to your needs and start learning how to use them. Get to know how these packages works and how to make best use out of them.
 * PRACTICE!
 * Work on projects related to your chosen area : Search for some already existing projects and work on them. Learn how these projects are structured and how these actually works. Work on various different kinds of project so that you can get a clear picture.
 * PRACTICE!
 * Create and work on your own projects : So after you get done with all the beginning steps, you are now ready to create and work on your own projects. Create some interesting projects, join communities, share knowledge, gain knowledge and keep going.
 * PRACTICE!
 * Work on more harder projects : Learn from your previous projects. Think on how you can make your project more faster and effective! KEEP GOING!
 * PRACTICE!

CONCLUSION : Python is evolving day by day. In my few years of Python programming, I myself saw it evolving and if I look back to few months or a year my own codes looks kinda outdated. You should be constantly in touch with Python if you want to make a career out of it. Keep learning and working on projects. At the end of the day, what matters is how much did you PRACTICED and LEARNED.

How do I learn Python Programming the most effective way?,"Hello,

I agree with Piort Grzesik, that you should learn by actually programming. Just ask yourself what you WANT to programm.

Pick a project that you are interested in. Do you like mangas? Write a manga downloader. Do you like finance? Learn about financial analysis with python. Interested in robotics? Build a robot.

Do you have to do lots of boring stuff that you can automate? Do that.

There is so much you can do with python. One of the best ressource in my eyes is the following webpage:

Python Programming Tutorials [ https://pythonprogramming.net/ ]

This guy also has a youtube page with lots more tutorials.

You can learn so much from that, same as I did from him.

Dont just read books. I did that. I read book after book, and when I was finished with the book I forgot half whats in there. Only by really programming will you remember what you did.

Again, pick up a project according to your interests, program it. There are lots of quora answers about projects you can do with python, look into them for ideas. Or write a comment with your interests and hobbies and we can think together about a starting project.

And then build stuff.

Let me know if I could help you.

How do I learn Python Programming the most effective way?,"I learnt Python programming from the Python documentation.

Python documentation is the best resource available in the Internet because it is the only official information regarding Python Language since it is penned by the creator of Python, Guido Van Rossum.

Most of my friends said that it was pretty much difficult for them to learn through the documentation and they went on to buy some random XYZ book for Python authored by some XYZ. But I believe that it’s not recommendable to learn Python from a book because:

1. It’s an open source software, therefore the information on the Internet is much more updated than the book.
2. Reading through the documentation helps you to understand the language in a deeper extent.
3. You may not find a good book for some packages of Python such as MNE, PsychoPy etc. But, there’s always a documentation available for them.
Therefore, if we make a habit of reading the documentation, then it’ll be pretty much useful to learn any language on our own without depending upon a book.

Also, if want to visualize how Python works graphically, then you might want to use PythonTutor [ http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit ].

One final thing about learning Python is to use it in daily life. If you had setup your Python environment variables perfectly, then it is just 2 steps away from using Python. That is:

1. Open you terminal/Command Prompt(Win+R and then type “cmd” in the “Run” dialog box for Windows, Win+Alt+T in Linux)
2. Now type “python” in the terminal and there you have it! The Python IDE.
In this, you can run simple scripts to make your daily life much more easier.

What are the best tips for learning Python within one month?,"Here is a Roadmap:

Week 1

Google Python programming fundamentals and pick on any good site. Tutorialspoint or any other should be fine. This should take you about a week say 8 hours per day while doing small scripts for practice to enforce your understanding. Note: never memorize the syntax, it will come naturally and looking up each time when you need it until you finally internalize it is the way to go.

Week 2, 3, 3.5

Pick up a project and start working to finish it. Some general tips when working on the project:

 * Don’t overthink, just pick on anything e.g basic calculator with a UI or could be anything that makes sense or google “beginner python projects” or something.
 * You don’t have to memorize or remember any syntax. So look up on the internet when you are stuck. Try to get hints on your problems.
 * Use an IDE (subjective but I prefer it since it is easier to debug and run scripts)
 * Breakdown the project to smaller components e.g if you are creating a calculator then:
 * 
 * Graphical User Interface - further into various buttons
 * Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication functions assigned to various buttons (note: there is no golden rule on how to break down projects, as long as they are manageable chunks)

 * Stackoverflow is a good friend. But make sure you don’t copy paste without understanding what the script does.
 * It will be hard and you need to be mentally strong to push through problems. When stuck on a problem:
1. 
1. 
1. Look it up on google and try finding the solution by being more precise with your search queries
2. If you don’t find a solution then post it on a forum where you might find some help.


 * You need small breaks when programming. It helps to get away from the computer for a while and come back.
 * 
 * May be this helps: Pomodoro Technique - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique ]

 * Invest time to learn version control. Should not take you more than a day or two. Basics should be fine. I prefer git.
 * Learn debugging as you go. Its not rocket science. Can take you literally take you only couple of hours to learn how to do it.
 * Ensure that you have a theoretical approach to solving the problem before you start writing any code. It won’t magically give you the correct result. Step aside from wishful thinking and be more practical. You can draw diagrams or write down what you want to achieve the result.
 * If you get time try investing a few hours learning testing and implement some tests in your code.
 * Don’t be frustrated if a problem takes long to solve but be aware of the time, you can move on to other components of the project to complete and come back later.
Week 3.5 / 4

Try smoke testing and ensuring that bugs are fixed. Now, if you have not complete then its alright, many at times we might not depending on some factors. In that case:

 * 
 * Allocate yourself more time (i.e more than a month)
 * Prioritize features that you might need for the project.

Congrats you are better than many programmer that have been going through tutorials for a year claiming they have learnt a lot. May be even better than a big percentage of 1st and 2nd year CS undergrads.

Imagine the possibilities you keep building projects for the year!

PS: To keep going you can start learning how databases work and learn some python frameworks to achieve what you want and build what you like.",https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-start-programming-to-learn-python-along-the-way?top_ans=65926013,2017-12-10T07:34:41.042777+00:00,2017-12-10T08:11:54.087520+00:00,618,Bhaulik Patel,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bhaulik-Patel-1
What are the best tips for learning Python within one month?,"1.) Practice Python Problems on Hackerrank: This is a good way to make sure you actually understand the material. Hackerrank makes it fun and the practice problems keeps you stimulated. Had I not done this, I would’ve forgotten everything I’d learn the very next week. Hackerrank problems help tremendously with retention.

2.) Set Up iPython/Jupyter Notebook: It helps to be able to quickly execute a few lines of code every so often while you’re learning. There are a lot of books that tell you to only execute an entire program with long lines of code. This is a bad way of learning. You need to get a good feel for how the computer reads each line of your code in the beginning.

3.) Have a Goal/Purpose in Mind: To learn Python in record time, you need a sense of urgency. I was super-ambitious and obviously overestimated myself when I let potential employers send me Python “tests” after only a week of learning Python. Needless to say, I couldn’t complete them after my first week of Python (but I could after my second or third week!). I still benefited greatly because this sense of urgency made forced me to sign up for video courses on Python Pandas, which I crammed for. The employer’s “tests” gave me a pretty good sense of which particular Python-related skills the job market was looking for.

4.) Build Real-World Applications/Programs: After you’re done with learning the Python basics/fundamentals, focus your attention on courses/materials that walk you through how to make specific real-world applications. I paid for some (inexpensive) Udemy courses after my first week that taught me how to make 8 or 10 real-world applications. This will give you a much better sense of the scope of Python. Some of the applications I built were standalone GUI interfaces with databases inside them, others were web scraping programs or websites. To broaden my net for jobs in the future, I also spent some time learning Machine Learning using Python on Kaggle (which hosts lots of Machine Learning/Data Science competitions).

All of this gave me an understanding that Python is used for literally everything - from making interactive websites (with Django) to Machine Learning (with Scikit-Learn) to creating financial/trading algorithms.",https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-start-programming-to-learn-python-along-the-way?top_ans=67522789,2017-12-24T21:16:18.922411+00:00,2017-12-24T22:16:26.418640+00:00,40,Pui Lam Yiu,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pui-Lam-Yiu
How do I learn Python Programming the most effective way?,"It all depends on how you learn and if you are already familiar with another language and/or CS fundamentals.

 * Start a project and work on it everyday.
 * 
 * Consistency is key.
 * Like spoken languages, the best way to learn is through repetition and forming associations in your brain.  You can't do this without regular exposure.
 * Ask for feedback!!!  This is one of the best ways to learn.
 * Don't use features that you don't understand.  It is hard to undo bad habits.

 * For book-learnin' types, pick any highly-rated introductory book and read it.  Read it many times.
 * 
 * If you get to intermediate level, ready anything by David Beazley.
 * Caveat:  Many people tend to disagree with me here but I can't think of a faster and more effective way to learn the basics.

 * Install and use IPython (aka Jupyter) interactively.
 * 
 * Use tab-complete to inspect all attributes and methods of an object.
 * Use the '?' feature to read docstrings on-the-fly.

 * Skim Welcome to Python.org [ http://Python.org ] standard lib docs.  Read over and over and over.

How do I learn Python by myself?,"One of the things that I found most frustrating when I was learning Python was how generic all the learning resources were. It seemed like every learning resource wanted me to spend 2 long, boring, months on Python syntax before I could even think about doing what interested me.

I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.

Lets take this code snippet for example :

[code]from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request): 
	return HttpResponse(""Hello, world. You're at the polls index."")
[/code]Experienced programmers will often throw snippets like the above at you. ""It's easy!"", they'll promise. But even a few seemingly simple lines of code can be incredibly confusing. For instance, why are some lines indented? What's [code ]django.http[/code]? Why are some things in parentheses? Understanding how everything fits together when you don't know much Python can be very hard.

The problem is that you need to understand the building blocks of the Python language to build anything interesting.Most tutorials assume that you need to learn all of Python syntax before you can start doing anything interesting. This is what leads to months spent just on syntax, when what you really want to be doing is analyzing data, or building a website, or creating an autonomous drone

Here are some tips to help you make the new concepts you are learning as a beginner programmer really stick:

1. Code Everyday : Consistency is very important when you are learning a new language. We recommend making a commitment to code every day. It may be hard to believe, but muscle memory plays a large part in programming. Committing to coding everyday will really help develop that muscle memory. Though it may seem daunting at first, consider starting small with 25 minutes everyday and working your way up from there.
2. Go Interactive : Whether you are learning about basic Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.) for the first time, or you are debugging an application, the interactive Python shell will be one of your best learning tools.
3. Build Something, Anything : For beginners, there are many small exercises that will really help you become confident with Python, as well as develop the muscle memory that we spoke about above. Once you have a solid grasp on basic data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, sets), object-oriented programming , and writing classes, it’s time to start building!What you build is not as important as how you build it. The journey of building is truly what will teach you the most. You can only learn so much from reading Real Python articles and courses. Most of your learning will come from using Python to build something. The problems you will solve will teach you a lot.There are many lists out there with ideas for beginner Python projects. Here are some ideas to get you started:
4. 
1. Number guessing game
2. Simple calculator app
3. Dice roll simulator

5. Contribute to Open Source : In the open-source model, software source code is available publicly, and anyone can collaborate. There are many Python libraries that are open-source projects and take contributions. Additionally, many companies publish open-source projects. This means you can work with code written and produced by the engineers working in these companies.
6. Take Breaks : When you are learning, it is important to step away and absorb the concepts.you work for 25 minutes, take a short break, and then repeat the process. Taking breaks is critical to having an effective study session, particularly when you are taking in a lot of new information.Breaks are especially important when you are debugging. If you hit a bug and can’t quite figure out what is going wrong, take a break. Step away from your computer, go for a walk .In programming, your code must follow the rules of a language and logic exactly, so even missing a quotation mark will break everything. Fresh eyes make a big difference.
Hope that helps :)

What is the way to learn Python quickly as a beginner?,"I don’t know if it is the way, but it is an approach I often propose on Quora. Following this method will allow you to learn programming principles using the Python language rather than just learn Python as a programming language.

This is an important distinction because in programming it is the fundamentals that are important. Once you understand those then the language you use is really just a matter of how appropriate it is for a given project. Happily Python is a decent language for many different types of projects.

Anyway, here are the steps:

1. Learn Python the Hard Way [ https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ ] has been the go to free resource to learn Python along with general good programming principles. This resource may still require you to develop in Python 2.x which is good because there is still a butt load of 2.x code out there. Finish this course and make sure you understand everything.
2. However, Python moved forward and so should you. https://inventwithpython.com/ is a brilliant resource for learning Python 3 (again from scratch). There are five tutorials/courses to do. Finish all of them.
3. Now that you have a great basis, register on CheckiO [ https://checkio.org/ ] and solve as many problems as you can. Here you are learning to code by playing a game. Solve as many challenges as you can, then try and solve each challenge with as little code as possible.
4. Also register at https://www.hackerrank.com [ https://www.hackerrank.com/ ] and start solving problems. The better you do, the better your chances of getting hired. These guys are hooked up to some serious employers, and your rank counts.
5. Remember to register on Stack Overflow [ http://stackoverflow.com/ ] where you will find willing and helpful programmers that can answer any well formulated questions you may have.
6. By now you will have enough knowledge to tackle Test-Driven Development with Python [ http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754 ] - this knowledge is critical as a skill in the workplace.
And there you have it - a full curriculum that you can do within three to six months (depending on your aptitude and the amount of time you have available).",https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-start-programming-to-learn-python-along-the-way?top_ans=42447598,2017-04-22T12:47:06.780271+00:00,,84,Gericke Potgieter,https://www.quora.com/profile/Gericke-Potgieter

Proof: If you can grok this extract in five minutes then yes, by all means you can learn Python programming in one month. But even reading this answer will take more than five minutes (let alone learning and practicing it), so we conclude that Python cannot be learnt in one month.

What if you’re an experienced programmer? Then you’d not have asked this question. ;)

Chapter 0

What do you think will be the result of dividing 7 over 5? Will it be a whole number or a decimal? In Python, a whole number is called an Integer (hereafter referred to as int) whereas a decimal is called a Float.

[code]7 / 5
%3E 1.4
[/code]What about 10/5? Will the result be an int?

[code]10 / 5
%3E 2.0
[/code]To our surprise, int division produced a float result. If we wanted to produce an int division, we should have done this:

[code]10 // 5
%3E 2
[/code]The // is called floor division. here’s why:

[code]6 // 4
%3E 1
[/code]Because floor division must produce integers, whatever is fractional or decimal is cut down. In the case above, the mathematical answer should have been 1.5, but since // produces only an int, the 0.5 part was truncated, leaving only the 1.

Along the same topic, we also have % for remainder. If you divide 16 over 5, the result is 3, but the remainder is 1. In Python, % means mod or modulus, and it works like this:

[code]16 % 3
%3E 1
[/code]The rest of the operations are:

[code]1 * 2 
%3E 2

4 - 2 
%3E 2

(4 + 5) * 8
%3E 72

# raising to a power is done with **

2**3
%3E 8
[/code]You must have noticed a comment (about raising to a power with **) that started with #. In programming, we write short comments within the code, so that we our future selves or others whose task is to read our code can make sense of some tricky and not immediately-obvious parts of our program. In Python, one-line comments start with #.

So far, we’ve used the numbers freely. As soon as we computed some mathematical expression, the task was done. Sometimes, however, we need to save numbers in containers that should interact with other containers to produce increasingly-complex results.

A container is merely a name that contains the data type—here a number—within itself.

For instance, let’s measure some cube. The cube’s height is 30 cm and its width is 15 cm, whereas its length is 40 cm.

Thus, we have three containers here: height, length and width. In python, locking a number within a container is called assignment. When you assign 10 to [code ]width[/code], you can then use width instead of typing 15 each time. Normally, a container is called a variable and that’s what we’ll say too.

Given the three variables, we can now compute the cube’s “Volume”. Then we can save (assign) the result to a variable called [code ]volume[/code].

[code]height = 30
width  = 10
length = 40

volume = height * width * length
[/code]So now that we have [code ]volume[/code], what can we do with it? In programming, the ‘verb’ which is something we do with variables goes by many names depending on the language. In Python, and more generally even, this is called a function.

A function does something useful and can be already existing in Python—called built-in—or it can be made from scratch by us. Note that each function has a unique name and you must never assign to a custom function you wrote, a name that belongs to a built-in function.

Suppose we wanted to inspect the contents of [code ]volume[/code]. The built-in function [code ]print[/code] will be enough:

[code]print(volume)
%3E 12000
[/code]You also notice that our function print has an opening and a closing parenthesis. All functions in Python have this, even when there’s nothing inside them. The thing inside the function’s parenthesis is called function argument, and if it exists, then we can say a function will be a transitive verb whereas a function argument will be the object of that verb: in other words, the function “does” what it’s supposed to do “to” the function argument.

In the jargon, we say “call a function” instead of using a function, and adding an argument to a function is referred to as “passing an argument to a function”.

Here is another built-in function: round(). It’s purpose is to round a decimal number. For instance, 900.9558 rounded to two decimals can be written as:

[code]round(900.9558, 2)
%3E 900.96
[/code]Now we will turn to the last item before we have a scaffolding in place to jump into programming: strings.

Simply, a string is something that is not considered a number and it is usually a letter, word, or a sentence. In Python, we use single or double quotes to represent a string. Here are some examples of strings:

[code]""j""
""Jan""
""I am Jan Meww, and you?""
""39""
[/code]Note that “39” is not a number or not considered a number because of being enclosed in quotes. The main thing that differentiates a number from a string is this: when you type a number in the console (interactive session), Python will automatically accept it as a number, but if you type a word or a letter, Python will throw or declare an error.

Now you’re ready. If you recall from high school, a Fibonacci sequence is sequence of numbers such, that as long as our number is more than 1, the next number is a sum of the previous two:

[math]0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5[/math]

Thus, [math]0+1 = 1, 1+1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3,  2 + 3 = 5,  3 + 5 = 8[/math], and [math]5 + 8 = 13[/math] and onwards. Note, as we add [math]1 + 2 = 3[/math], we take the two numbers on both sides of the equal sign and add them up: [math]2 + 3 = 5[/math]. Now the two numbers on both sides of the = are [math]3[/math] and [math]5[/math], so we add these up, and so forth.

Programming is giving well-defined instructions to a computer so that there are no ambiguities that might lead the computer to make a mistake. On the contrary, among humans, instructions can be ambiguous and still understood because our body language, tone, cultural references, and the context can provide plenty of cues to our minds.

There’s a well-known joke (well-known among programmers, though) about this:


%3E A woman asks her husband, a programmer, to go shopping:

-Dear, please, go to the nearby grocery store to buy some bread. Also, if they have eggs, buy a dozen.

-OK, hun.

Twenty minutes later the husband comes back bringing 12 loaves of bread.

His wife is flabbergasted:

-Why on earth did you buy a dozen loaves of bread?

-They had eggs
The joke reflects how computers think and how programmers are affected by that precise level of thinking. This is not such a bad thing as the joke implies; in fact, the art of providing clear, concise instruction to a computer will sharpen your brain and also fine-tune it to detect weak arguments.

The problem in the above joke is that the wife said: “if they have eggs, buy a dozen”. For humans it is easy to see that the comma in the sentence above implies that the dozen is connected to the eggs, but computers cannot infer commas. A computer deals with sentences and instructions as they are, which makes it a little difficult to get used to at first.

Recasting the same joke to make a computer understand it as we do should have resulted in:

“if they have eggs, then in addition to buying some bread, buy a dozen eggs, too”.

Even this has a problem, because the computer won’t buy bread if the shop did not have eggs. We can rephrase it:

“First, buy some bread. Then, if they have eggs, buy a dozen eggs, too.”

Now this is unambiguous.

Returning to the Fibonacci, our Fibonacci sequence is well-defined because it contains no ambiguities and the computer can make sense of it; we say “take two numbers [code ]a[/code] and [code ]b[/code], turn [code ]a[/code] to [code ]b[/code], and turn [code ]b[/code] to [code ]a+b[/code]”. And most likely we will also add a stopping point so that it does not go on forever: “continue to do this up to some limit.”

How would we write this as code? We need a proper way to inform Python that we want to add the previous two numbers and present them in a sequence. This requires a loop.

A loop is a programming concept that can be approximately called a “do this during this duration”. One loop we will see now is called [code ]while[/code]. So let’s first see this program and then dissect it:

[code]a, b = 0, 1
while a %3C 20:
	a, b = b, a+b
	print(a)
[/code]You will have noticed that we can assign several variables at the same time. We assigned [math]0[/math] to [code ]a[/code] and [math]1[/math] to[code ] b[/code] at the same time, separated by a comma. Next, we instruct Python that as long as [code ]a[/code] is less than [math]20[/math], do the following tasks. The colon at the end of [math]20[/math] is represents the concept of “following tasks”.

Another thing you noticed after the colon is that the code automatically will go 4 spaces to the right (in most Python editors it does this automatically. If it does not, you have to do this manually yourself, but in practice this is done automatically to prevent errors in miscalculated spaces).

More specifically, this spacing is called indentation, and the four-space indentation is unique only to Python; because Python cares about the white space around the code, the core idea behind indentation is to make the code easier on the eyes, especially if we have long pages of code.

Next, as long as [code ]a[/code] is less than [math]20[/math], we will start by assigning the value of [code ]b[/code] to [code ]a[/code], and the value of[code ] a+b[/code] to [code ]b[/code]. This is very similar to adding the two numbers on the two sides of the = sign I showed earlier. If [code ]a[/code] was [math]2[/math] and [code ]b[/code] was [math]3[/math], then the next [code ]a[/code] will be [math]3[/math] whereas the next [code ]b[/code] will be [math](2+3)[/math] or [math]5[/math]. Thus, for the next round, the next [code ]a[/code] will change from [math]3[/math] and become [math]5[/math], while the next [code ]b[/code] will become [math](3+5)[/math] or [math]8[/math], and so forth.

Finally, we also instruct Python to display all the values that [code ]a[/code] takes during its [code ]while[/code] journey:

Now that you’re exposed to the [code ]while[/code] loop, another important foundation concept is the conditional; in Python, the conditional is [code ]if[/code], and acts like “if” as humans use it. Suppose I am 40 years old, and one of my acquaintances is Python. If we were to ask Python whether Jan is 40, we would make use of [code ]==[/code] which stands for ‘equal to’. Let’s see what Python says about this:

[code]# first we make sure Jan is 40
jan = 40

# then we check whether this is really so
jan == 40
%3E true
[/code]Python agrees. What about:

[code]Jan == 40
[/code]Will it evaluate to [code ]true[/code] as well? No, because variable names are case-sensitive. jan and Jan are not the same thing.

I also want to mention that assigning a value to a variable, say:

[code]Meww = 40
[/code]And then assigning 39 to Meww will result in Meww becoming 39, because that is the last value we assigned to Meww; A container can only contain one value and when we assign 39 to Meww, 40 has to go. (so that 39 can take its place.)

But go where? Python automatically clears the space for the newly assigned 39, and 40 goes to the virtual ‘thrash can’. In the jargon, this is called automatic garbage collection, a concept Python borrowed from Lisp. (And not all languages have this.)

Next, you will see an error that was caused by mistyping. This is the most frequent cause of beginner level mistakes in code:

As you can see, Jann is something unrecognized by Python, and it will mention this to us in its error message, even though, Python’s error messages are rather cryptic.

Now, let’s use the conditional[code ] if[/code]. If Jan is 40, Python should say something more than true; perhaps we can ask it to say: “Congrats, you’re still young!”:

[code]Jan = 40
if Jan == 40:
	print(“Congrats, you’re still young!”)
[/code]That is it. Now what happens if Jan is not 40? We can also insert additional conditional clauses in there: suppose we wanted this: if Jan is 40 then print “hoorah” and if Meww is 39, then print “congrats”.

[code]Jan, Meww = 40, 39
if Jan == 40:
	print(""hoorah!"")
if Meww == 39:
	print(""congrats!"")
[/code]The conditional does not stop there. We can add further conditions. Suppose you instruct your robot to go to the Mall and buy milk and eggs. You could say something like this:

[code]# define the variables:

eggs = ""eggs""
bread = ""bread""

if eggs == true:
	buy(eggs)
else:
	buy(bread)
[/code]First, we instruct the robot to recognize eggs and bread when it sees them. In the solution space—which is the page where we write our Python code—this means assigning strings “eggs” and “bread” to the variables of the same name, so that we can use those names directly, without attaching quotes to them each time. This enhances readability but also prevents errors.

Next, we add a conditional which is the equivalent of “if eggs are available in the Mall”. In Python, existence and availability is synonymous with [code ]true[/code]. If something is [code ]true[/code], then it exists and can be used.

The final step was instructing the robot what to do; we learned earlier that doing something was a function, and functions look like this: [code ]function(argument)[/code] if transitive but also [code ]function()[/code] if intransitive. While the syntax of our code above is correct, the function [code ]buy(something)[/code] is not already defined in Python, and the robot will not recognize it. Thus, we will also have to define—create—this function and include correct and clear instructions in the body of this function so that Python can execute it according to our wishes.

A function is made with a keyword [code ]def[/code], a function name, and a body. Here the function name is [code ]greet[/code], and the body’s task is to say “Hello!”.

Like so:

[code]def greet():
	print(""Hello!"")
[/code]This is an argumentless function (intransitive), so when we call (access or put it to use) it, it must also be argumentless:

[code]greet()
%3E Hello!
[/code]We can also make functions that take arguments—what I earlier termed transitive. Suppose the robot will greet by name. Thus, the name of the person it greets is the argument:

[code]def greet(name):
	print(""Hello!"", name)
[/code]Let’s see it in action:

[code]greet(""Jan"")
%3E Hello! Jan
[/code]Note that the placeholder argument [code ]name[/code] must be a string, since names are made of letters—and not numbers. This is why Jan was written as [code ]“Jan”[/code]. But we could have done this too:

[code]greet(5)
%3E Hello! 5
[/code]This is both a strength and a weakness in Python but beyond the scope of this post. Consider this, though: in certain languages, like Julia, argument type can be specified at the time we define a function, but as of this writing, not in Python.

So when you define

[code]def greet(name):
  print(""hi"", name)
[/code]In Python, you cannot force-specify what type of input name could be. This leads to more flexibility as you saw earlier, but also to potentially hidden bugs or errors.

Finally, note the comma between name and “Hello!”. This is the first time you see [code ]print()[/code] taking two arguments separated by a comma. However, the ability of a function to take n arguments is restricted by its construction.

Thus, [code ]print()[/code] is built-in and constructed to take more than one argument, whereas [code ]greet()[/code] is not because we only passed [code ]name[/code] as the maximum number of arguments it should accept.

How did you do? How long did it take?

How can I learn Python in 1 month?,"Well, the answer is damn Yes.

Yes, you can learn Python within one month. But you have to read me carefully. There are a few steps you have to follow during this 1 month. So, here we go.

Step 1: Don't go for any tutorial on the internet.

Why I'm saying is that,


%3E You are the only Guru of yourself to get things very fast.
Buy a book or collect from anywhere of Python 3. Yes, I'll repeat, go for Python 3. Please don't go for Python 2.

I'll recommend you to take learn Python the Hard Way [ https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html ] book as your guide. This is one of the best books in Python for beginners like you.

Step 2: Download an app DataCamp - Learn R, Python & SQL - Apps on Google Play [ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datacamp ] from play store( If you are an Android user) or DataCamp - Learn R & Python on the App Store [ https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/datacamp-learn-r-python/id1263413087 ] from App store (If you are a Richie Rich)

And keep doing practice on hand when you'll be free.

Step 3: Stop watching some useless video and start watching some Python stuff on YouTube.

And, that's it. After a month you'll see yourself as a Python programmer.

You've taken a great step, my dear mate. Go for it, because Python will tell you what you want to be after one month.

Hope it'll help you. Do follow me for a new programming relationship. All the best for your new beginning.",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-Python-in-a-month?top_ans=82205646,2018-05-05T07:37:19.275529+00:00,2019-11-14T14:02:07.676594+00:00,163,Shritam Kumar Mund,https://www.quora.com/profile/Shritam-Kumar-Mund
Can I learn Python in a month?,"Absolutely you can.

If this is your first programming language you have to learn first how to solve problems using programming. If you already know any other language it will be much faster.

I believe to learn any programming language better, you have to do projects. Learning the syntax of a language is not time-consuming. But to understand it and figuring out some special techniques, it is very important to do projects. It is always good to choose easier and smaller project when you are learning so that you can start and finish the project.

For Python, it is important to learn the libraries as well. Choose any field of your interest ( i.e Machine learning, Web development, task automation, etc), then learn some important libraries for that field. For example, for machine learning/ data science ( if you know the theories already ), you have to know Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas at least. Then, of course, some other libraries like Sklearn, Tensorflow, etc. So learn those and starting solving problems from your project using those libs. For web development at least you have to know any web framework like Flask or Django and of course other libs what can be necessary.

All the best and happy coding",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-Python-in-a-month?top_ans=166426764,2019-09-09T11:38:48.367330+00:00,2019-09-09T11:46:40.007936+00:00,8,Akbar Moshur Alam,https://www.quora.com/profile/Akbar-Moshur-Alam-1
Can I learn Python in a month?,"Yes learning python in a month is possible.

In a month its will be only learning, you will learn to do basic level programming like examples that you came across while learning. So my suggestion is to learn optimising the code while you learn basic examples. You can write a code that does same job in few lines as well 100s of lines.

To learn optimising join hacker rank python, they have easy problems to solve, but in discussions sections you will see how experts written same job in few lines. Learn from those lessons.

In short, this is how I started and learning.

1. YouTube tutorials
2. Hacker rank
3. Apply python on you daily task.
4. Help others in stack overflow and learn from it.

How long does it take to learn Python?,"For me it took 3 months! and 219 Pomodoro!

My status before I started:

 * I don’t have any programming background at all.
 * I’m bad at math.
 * I Don’t know what's algoritmes.
 * I don’t know how to learn!
My advice for you:

You need to have two main things: a purpose and to be patient as a mountain! Also, do not rely on your passion or feelings. Because they come and go randomly. Instead, rely on continuous work.

Additionally, you need to learn how to learn! This is very important if you want to be a fast learner. There is a free short course titled Learning how to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects. And if you want to go farther there is also a book called A mind for numbers. Read also chapter 3 from a book called soft skills by John Sonmez about learning. Plus there is a nice youtube video, The first 20 hours. You may want to have a look at it.

Furthermore, you need to vary your resource learning. I mean you need to try learning from many materials like online courses, books, youtube series tutorials, practicing solo!

My experience to learn Python

My purpose was weird! I needed to learn Python to learn java and start programming Android apps, because in the past I jumped to learn java in android platform, java was hell to me! Then I decided to learn an easier language together with the OOP (object-oriented programming principles). Including math and algorithms, it took me three months.

Now I start to learn java and it seems more easier than before (long code but easier in understanding and memories). I’m on my way to seek the Pythonic road! I don’t know why I should still learn Python but this language is addictive :)",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-Python-in-a-month?top_ans=24338276,2016-06-25T07:31:46.051679+00:00,2017-04-23T05:27:12.023127+00:00,1113,Anonymous,
Can I learn Python in a month?,"Yes you can and it is very easy to do so !!!

You can start with basics and finish them very quick. These include data types, variables, integers and functions, floats and functions, strings and manipulations, lists/tuples/sets and manipulation. You would need to practice slicing lists/strings and working on methods/functions on each of them

Second set of work would be on conditions (if,elif,else), for and while loops with break and continue statements. I would suggest you start working on assignment problems for “for” loops more as Pythonic for loops make life a lot easy than other languages.

Third set would be to learn functions. Start with simple basic functions, declaring and calling them and then returning value(s). Then go on to Default and Optional parms, *args and **kwargs.

You can do all of the above in just two weeks and this will be most of the Python basics you do.

From here you can start with higher order functions where you pass function as parameter to another function. map, filter, reduce and lambda functions would be next logical step. This will just take a couple of days

Then learn about classes. How you can declare a class, the __init__method, declaring methods, using getter and setter properties, inheritance, class variables and then calling these methods from outside as well as from another class. Then learn about the “magic” methods. I suggest you do this with a very slow speed and do not proceed until your concepts are clear and you can use the remaining 4–5 days of the third week on this.

For the remaining 9 days of the month you can then start with

 * Modules (Don’t try to learn everything to start with, just some basic ones like random, sys, os, os.path, datetime, time and math
 * Create your own modules and call them in other program
 * List and Dictionary Comprehensions
 * File handling with text files and csv files with the csv module
If you still have time, learn Generators and Decorators (Though they are not basic anymore, thy fall more into intermediate Python). Also learn numpy and pandas (For these , I wont count them in basic Python too as if you plan to do Devops or Django/Flask you may not need them)

I hope this helps !!!",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-Python-in-a-month?top_ans=168869862,2019-09-20T13:57:04.702448+00:00,,15,Abhijeet Kulkarni,https://www.quora.com/profile/Abhijeet-Kulkarni-21

Yes, you can learn python in one month but understanding python takes more than one month.

If you learn python then you will know how code work but if you understand the python then you will understand the how python works.

To make this easy, you need to understand how python works in order to understand the advanced topics of python like decorators, generators, memory management etc.,

What are the best tips for learning Python within one month?,"Here is a Roadmap:

Week 1

Google Python programming fundamentals and pick on any good site. Tutorialspoint or any other should be fine. This should take you about a week say 8 hours per day while doing small scripts for practice to enforce your understanding. Note: never memorize the syntax, it will come naturally and looking up each time when you need it until you finally internalize it is the way to go.

Week 2, 3, 3.5

Pick up a project and start working to finish it. Some general tips when working on the project:

 * Don’t overthink, just pick on anything e.g basic calculator with a UI or could be anything that makes sense or google “beginner python projects” or something.
 * You don’t have to memorize or remember any syntax. So look up on the internet when you are stuck. Try to get hints on your problems.
 * Use an IDE (subjective but I prefer it since it is easier to debug and run scripts)
 * Breakdown the project to smaller components e.g if you are creating a calculator then:
 * 
 * Graphical User Interface - further into various buttons
 * Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication functions assigned to various buttons (note: there is no golden rule on how to break down projects, as long as they are manageable chunks)

 * Stackoverflow is a good friend. But make sure you don’t copy paste without understanding what the script does.
 * It will be hard and you need to be mentally strong to push through problems. When stuck on a problem:
1. 
1. 
1. Look it up on google and try finding the solution by being more precise with your search queries
2. If you don’t find a solution then post it on a forum where you might find some help.


 * You need small breaks when programming. It helps to get away from the computer for a while and come back.
 * 
 * May be this helps: Pomodoro Technique - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique ]

 * Invest time to learn version control. Should not take you more than a day or two. Basics should be fine. I prefer git.
 * Learn debugging as you go. Its not rocket science. Can take you literally take you only couple of hours to learn how to do it.
 * Ensure that you have a theoretical approach to solving the problem before you start writing any code. It won’t magically give you the correct result. Step aside from wishful thinking and be more practical. You can draw diagrams or write down what you want to achieve the result.
 * If you get time try investing a few hours learning testing and implement some tests in your code.
 * Don’t be frustrated if a problem takes long to solve but be aware of the time, you can move on to other components of the project to complete and come back later.
Week 3.5 / 4

Try smoke testing and ensuring that bugs are fixed. Now, if you have not complete then its alright, many at times we might not depending on some factors. In that case:

 * 
 * Allocate yourself more time (i.e more than a month)
 * Prioritize features that you might need for the project.

"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","I've been learning python for about six months now. Not spending 8 hours a day on it but more as a hobby. 
I started less than a year ago with html, css and javascript. So I did start python with some solid knowledge on what code and programming is about. 
Of course, when starting python, I fell in love with the syntax and simplicity this language offers. It also allowed me to easily learn some complex programming concepts that I am able to use in other languages I sometimes have fun with (for example VBA). 
After six months of python I have had a few projects going on and here are the major things I worked on, chronologically:

1. I created a bot that plays an online game for me. It works recognizing images on the screen and clicking where appropriate. This was a great experience as it was the first ""big"" program I ever wrote.
2. Raspberry pi: working on this one with my brother. We have had different projects. Starting from lighting up lights to a self driving car:
1. ​

​​​our next goal with this one is to add a camera and be able to control the car from a website.
2. OpenPyxl: I use a lot of Excel for work. VBA is a great language but I like being able to do things through python, completely in the dark and once I open excel it magically copied and compared data from different files. So many things happen ""underneath"" that I haven't been able to do with VBA.
3. Django: is what I try to focus on the most more recently. If I want to one day work in the tech industry I believe Web Development is the best route for me to start in. Django is really powerful and starts making sense (I have to say the beginning seemed a little overwhelming because there are a lot of things that need to be understood, as well as the links between those things) to me. I think the fact I started with html, css and javascript is really going to help me out in Django projects so I'm looking forward to the future things I will create.
After 6 months I'm pretty happy with the python level I have reached. I hope I'll manage to double this knowledge in the next six months. And be able to apply as much as possible in my day to day life (current job, personal apps, other projects) on order to keep it as exciting as it has been.

I hope this answer gives you an idea of what the next few months might look like for you.",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-Python-in-a-month?top_ans=20000613,2016-02-27T09:25:40.219988+00:00,2020-06-07T10:48:17.656062+00:00,1464,Pierre Corbin,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pierre-Corbin
Can I learn Python in a month?,"You can easily learn (and get quite good at) Python in a month and boy, are you in for a treat! Within a week of using Python, you may feel like never going back to using other programming languages ever again because of how incredibly programmer friendly it is.

The many ways you can manipulate data with such ridiculous ease in Python is astounding and will probably make you wonder why you weren’t taught Python when you were just just starting to write code. It’s one of the most beginner friendly programming languages out there.

I could go on and on about the many things I love about Python but that’s not what you asked. I highly recommend taking MIT’s 6.100.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python [ https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9 ] to learn the language. It is easily one of the best computer science courses available for free through edX and it’ll teach you how to think like a programmer. The course uses Python as the language of choice so you will learn a lot about Python from taking this course, but bear in mind that it does not teach you all there is to learn about Python but is a great starting point to get introduced to this lovely programming language.

After you’ve completed the course, you may want to put that newfound knowledge to the test by solving (easy and medium difficulty) Python programming challenges on Codewars [ https://www.codewars.com ] and CodingBat Python [ http://codingbat.com/python ].

I’d highly recommend Automate the Boring Stuff with Python [ https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ ] as well because nothing is more satisfying than getting a computer to do your work for you.",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-Python-in-a-month?top_ans=39738105,2017-03-21T16:40:04.318923+00:00,,33,Vinayak Suraj,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vinayak-Suraj-1
How do I learn Python?,"The most important question to answer first is why do I want to learn python? Answering this will guide what you use to learn and how you learn.

Starting with a very generic list of resources to learn python when you eventually want to make websites (for example), will not only reduce your motivation, it will also make it much harder to apply the knowledge you gain.  I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.

When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.

1.  Find what motivates you

Finding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.

Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.

Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.

Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:
 * Websites
 * Mobile apps
 * Games
 * Data science/Machine learning

2.  Learn some basic python syntax

Unless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.

For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.

Some resources that can help you:

 * Codecademy [ http://www.codecademy.com ] -- does a good job of teaching basic syntax.
 * Learn python the hard way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] -- a book that teaches a lot of python concepts.

 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] -- this is my startup.  It's focused on teaching python for data science, but it teaches all the basic syntax also.
 * The Python Tutorial [ https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ ] -- the tutorial on the main python site.

I can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.

3.  Make structured projects in your chosen area

Unless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.

When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:

Games
 * Codecademy  [ http://www.codecademy.com- ]-- walks you through making a couple of simple games.
 * Pygame tutorials [ http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials ] -- pygame (the python library for making games) has a good list of tutorials
 * Making games with pygame [ http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982106017 ] -- this book looks like a great way to learn python by making games

Websites
 * Flask tutorial [ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/ ] -- the official flask (simple python web framework) tutorial.
 * Bottle tutorial [ http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html ] -- Bottle (even simpler web framework for python) tutorial. 

 * How To Tango With Django 1.7 [ http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/ ] -- a guide to using django (more complex python web framework)
Mobile apps
 * Kivy guide [ http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html-- ] -- Kivy is the tool that lets you make mobile apps with python.  They have a guide on how to get started.
Data science
 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] --  Teaches you python and data science interactively.  You analyze a series of interesting datasets ranging from CIA documents to NBA player stats.
 * Scikit-learn documentation [ http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html ] -- Scikit-learn (the main machine learning library for python) has some great documentation and tutorials.
 * Python for Data Analysis [ http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do ] -- written by the author of a major python data analysis library (pandas), it's a good introduction to analyzing data in python.

4.  Work on projects on your own

Once you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.

Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.

Some ideas:
 *  Extend the projects you were working on previously, and add more functionality.
 * Go to python meetups in your area, and find people who are working on interesting projects.
 * Find open source packages to contribute to.
 * See if any local nonprofits are looking for volunteer developers.
 * Find projects other people have made, and see if you can extend or adapt them.
My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.

The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.

5.  Keep working on harder projects

Keep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.

Here are some ideas for when that time comes:
 * Try teaching a novice how to do your current project.
 * Try load testing your website -- can you scale it up?
 * Can you make your program run faster?

Going forward

At the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it. 

You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.

Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-Python-in-a-month?top_ans=13841814,2015-07-07T13:40:55.951227+00:00,,3046,Vik Paruchuri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vik-Paruchuri

Can I learn Python in a month?,"Hi

Yes.
Here is how.
I assume you know basic coding in C or similar language.

Now - just think what problems you have in your life, computing - 
example - maybe you want to see python examples with explaination .

just think what you wish to solve for your own needs.

or you do not wish to miss a tv episode.

maybe you need to know which of your gal fb friends is single and so on.
hopefully your problem is not already solved.

now just start coding.

if you get stuck search stack overflow or refer the python docs.
or even if still stuck - ask on irc.

initially progress will be slow.
but it will soon pick up.

just keep coding and thinking.

How long did it take you to master Python?,"It took me 4 hours (four hours) to write my first, very simple working program (a very simple file-system maintenance tool).

It took me one week (one week) to write the first, small program actually used by the company I was working at that time (a small “devops” tool).

It took me 3 to 6 months (three to six months) to experiment each and every “dark corner” of the language and a large part of its standard library (Python was at version 1.X at that time. Python 3 is significantly larger and more complex).

It will took me forever to actually master it and to explore all of the available libraries.

I was already a Perl, Javascript, and Basic developer when I started to use Python. Using Python when you already know Perl is trivial.

For what I have seen in the last 20 years, an individual with absolutely no prior programming knowledge can usually learn the basics of Python (studying it alone, using web resources) and write his/her first Python program in a week or two and can become proficient in the language in one to three months (just the language, no frameworks and libraries like Django or TensorFlow).

What are the best tips for learning Python within one month?,"1.) Practice Python Problems on Hackerrank: This is a good way to make sure you actually understand the material. Hackerrank makes it fun and the practice problems keeps you stimulated. Had I not done this, I would’ve forgotten everything I’d learn the very next week. Hackerrank problems help tremendously with retention.

2.) Set Up iPython/Jupyter Notebook: It helps to be able to quickly execute a few lines of code every so often while you’re learning. There are a lot of books that tell you to only execute an entire program with long lines of code. This is a bad way of learning. You need to get a good feel for how the computer reads each line of your code in the beginning.

3.) Have a Goal/Purpose in Mind: To learn Python in record time, you need a sense of urgency. I was super-ambitious and obviously overestimated myself when I let potential employers send me Python “tests” after only a week of learning Python. Needless to say, I couldn’t complete them after my first week of Python (but I could after my second or third week!). I still benefited greatly because this sense of urgency made forced me to sign up for video courses on Python Pandas, which I crammed for. The employer’s “tests” gave me a pretty good sense of which particular Python-related skills the job market was looking for.

4.) Build Real-World Applications/Programs: After you’re done with learning the Python basics/fundamentals, focus your attention on courses/materials that walk you through how to make specific real-world applications. I paid for some (inexpensive) Udemy courses after my first week that taught me how to make 8 or 10 real-world applications. This will give you a much better sense of the scope of Python. Some of the applications I built were standalone GUI interfaces with databases inside them, others were web scraping programs or websites. To broaden my net for jobs in the future, I also spent some time learning Machine Learning using Python on Kaggle (which hosts lots of Machine Learning/Data Science competitions).

All of this gave me an understanding that Python is used for literally everything - from making interactive websites (with Django) to Machine Learning (with Scikit-Learn) to creating financial/trading algorithms.",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-learn-Python-in-a-month?top_ans=67522789,2017-12-24T21:16:18.922411+00:00,2017-12-24T22:16:26.418640+00:00,40,Pui Lam Yiu,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pui-Lam-Yiu

1. Set Clear Goals: Define what you want to achieve with Python programming. Do you want to build web applications, work with data, or something else? This will help you stay focused.
2. Find Quality Learning Resources: Look for beginner-friendly Python tutorials, online courses, and books. Some popular resources include Codecademy, Coursera, and ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" by Al Sweigart.
3. Practice Regularly: Dedicate time each day to practice coding. Start with small projects and gradually increase the complexity as you gain confidence.
4. Join a Community: Engage with online communities such as Stack Overflow, Reddit's r/learnpython, or local coding meetups. Learning from others and getting help when you're stuck can be invaluable.
5. Work on Real Projects: Apply what you learn by working on real-world projects. This could be anything from building a simple game to automating a task at work.
6. Seek Feedback: Share your code with others and ask for feedback. Constructive criticism can help you improve your coding skills.
7. Stay Persistent: Learning to code can be challenging at times, but persistence is key. Stay motivated and don't get discouraged by setbacks.

How can I learn Python in 1 month?,"Well, the answer is damn Yes.

Yes, you can learn Python within one month. But you have to read me carefully. There are a few steps you have to follow during this 1 month. So, here we go.

Step 1: Don't go for any tutorial on the internet.

Why I'm saying is that,


%3E You are the only Guru of yourself to get things very fast.
Buy a book or collect from anywhere of Python 3. Yes, I'll repeat, go for Python 3. Please don't go for Python 2.

I'll recommend you to take learn Python the Hard Way [ https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html ] book as your guide. This is one of the best books in Python for beginners like you.

Step 2: Download an app DataCamp - Learn R, Python & SQL - Apps on Google Play [ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datacamp ] from play store( If you are an Android user) or DataCamp - Learn R & Python on the App Store [ https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/datacamp-learn-r-python/id1263413087 ] from App store (If you are a Richie Rich)

And keep doing practice on hand when you'll be free.

Step 3: Stop watching some useless video and start watching some Python stuff on YouTube.

And, that's it. After a month you'll see yourself as a Python programmer.

You've taken a great step, my dear mate. Go for it, because Python will tell you what you want to be after one month.

What are the best tips for learning Python within one month?,"Here is a Roadmap:

Week 1

Google Python programming fundamentals and pick on any good site. Tutorialspoint or any other should be fine. This should take you about a week say 8 hours per day while doing small scripts for practice to enforce your understanding. Note: never memorize the syntax, it will come naturally and looking up each time when you need it until you finally internalize it is the way to go.

Week 2, 3, 3.5

Pick up a project and start working to finish it. Some general tips when working on the project:

 * Don’t overthink, just pick on anything e.g basic calculator with a UI or could be anything that makes sense or google “beginner python projects” or something.
 * You don’t have to memorize or remember any syntax. So look up on the internet when you are stuck. Try to get hints on your problems.
 * Use an IDE (subjective but I prefer it since it is easier to debug and run scripts)
 * Breakdown the project to smaller components e.g if you are creating a calculator then:
 * 
 * Graphical User Interface - further into various buttons
 * Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication functions assigned to various buttons (note: there is no golden rule on how to break down projects, as long as they are manageable chunks)

 * Stackoverflow is a good friend. But make sure you don’t copy paste without understanding what the script does.
 * It will be hard and you need to be mentally strong to push through problems. When stuck on a problem:
1. 
1. 
1. Look it up on google and try finding the solution by being more precise with your search queries
2. If you don’t find a solution then post it on a forum where you might find some help.


 * You need small breaks when programming. It helps to get away from the computer for a while and come back.
 * 
 * May be this helps: Pomodoro Technique - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique ]

 * Invest time to learn version control. Should not take you more than a day or two. Basics should be fine. I prefer git.
 * Learn debugging as you go. Its not rocket science. Can take you literally take you only couple of hours to learn how to do it.
 * Ensure that you have a theoretical approach to solving the problem before you start writing any code. It won’t magically give you the correct result. Step aside from wishful thinking and be more practical. You can draw diagrams or write down what you want to achieve the result.
 * If you get time try investing a few hours learning testing and implement some tests in your code.
 * Don’t be frustrated if a problem takes long to solve but be aware of the time, you can move on to other components of the project to complete and come back later.
Week 3.5 / 4

Try smoke testing and ensuring that bugs are fixed. Now, if you have not complete then its alright, many at times we might not depending on some factors. In that case:

 * 
 * Allocate yourself more time (i.e more than a month)
 * Prioritize features that you might need for the project.

Congrats you are better than many programmer that have been going through tutorials for a year claiming they have learnt a lot. May be even better than a big percentage of 1st and 2nd year CS undergrads.

Imagine the possibilities you keep building projects for the year!

PS: To keep going you can start learning how databases work and learn some python frameworks to achieve what you want and build what you like.",https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-learn-Python-programming-in-two-months?top_ans=65926013,2017-12-10T07:34:41.042777+00:00,2017-12-10T08:11:54.087520+00:00,618,Bhaulik Patel,https://www.quora.com/profile/Bhaulik-Patel-1
How do I learn Python?,"The most important question to answer first is why do I want to learn python? Answering this will guide what you use to learn and how you learn.

Starting with a very generic list of resources to learn python when you eventually want to make websites (for example), will not only reduce your motivation, it will also make it much harder to apply the knowledge you gain.  I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.

When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.

1.  Find what motivates you

Finding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.

Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.

Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.

Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:
 * Websites
 * Mobile apps
 * Games
 * Data science/Machine learning

2.  Learn some basic python syntax

Unless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.

For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.

Some resources that can help you:

 * Codecademy [ http://www.codecademy.com ] -- does a good job of teaching basic syntax.
 * Learn python the hard way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] -- a book that teaches a lot of python concepts.

 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] -- this is my startup.  It's focused on teaching python for data science, but it teaches all the basic syntax also.
 * The Python Tutorial [ https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ ] -- the tutorial on the main python site.

I can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.

3.  Make structured projects in your chosen area

Unless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.

When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:

Games
 * Codecademy  [ http://www.codecademy.com- ]-- walks you through making a couple of simple games.
 * Pygame tutorials [ http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials ] -- pygame (the python library for making games) has a good list of tutorials
 * Making games with pygame [ http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982106017 ] -- this book looks like a great way to learn python by making games

Websites
 * Flask tutorial [ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/ ] -- the official flask (simple python web framework) tutorial.
 * Bottle tutorial [ http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html ] -- Bottle (even simpler web framework for python) tutorial. 

 * How To Tango With Django 1.7 [ http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/ ] -- a guide to using django (more complex python web framework)
Mobile apps
 * Kivy guide [ http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html-- ] -- Kivy is the tool that lets you make mobile apps with python.  They have a guide on how to get started.
Data science
 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] --  Teaches you python and data science interactively.  You analyze a series of interesting datasets ranging from CIA documents to NBA player stats.
 * Scikit-learn documentation [ http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html ] -- Scikit-learn (the main machine learning library for python) has some great documentation and tutorials.
 * Python for Data Analysis [ http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do ] -- written by the author of a major python data analysis library (pandas), it's a good introduction to analyzing data in python.

4.  Work on projects on your own

Once you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.

Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.

Some ideas:
 *  Extend the projects you were working on previously, and add more functionality.
 * Go to python meetups in your area, and find people who are working on interesting projects.
 * Find open source packages to contribute to.
 * See if any local nonprofits are looking for volunteer developers.
 * Find projects other people have made, and see if you can extend or adapt them.
My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.

The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.

5.  Keep working on harder projects

Keep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.

Here are some ideas for when that time comes:
 * Try teaching a novice how to do your current project.
 * Try load testing your website -- can you scale it up?
 * Can you make your program run faster?

Going forward

At the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it. 

You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.

Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-learn-Python-programming-in-two-months?top_ans=13841814,2015-07-07T13:40:55.951227+00:00,,3046,Vik Paruchuri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vik-Paruchuri

How do I learn Python?,"The easiest way to learn a programming language is to first learn the basics and then try to build something with it (learn by doing). And it's better if you are building something you are actually interested in rather than something out of a book because it will get you to think about the problem and be more meaningful. 

Python is easy to learn (not much syntax), easy to read (explicit vs implicit), has a big ecosystem (more packages/libraries), is taught at universities so it's easy to find good programmers to help, and is used by many large websites/companies (e.g., Quora is programmed in Python) so it's a good language to know.

I still feel one can make most of these days and they can have a huge impact on our future.


First things first, I believe you just need few resources and loads of motivation to learn any skill.

And personally I feel these days Internet is pure gold in terms of resources and that too free.


Here I have tried to summarize all my learnings, resources, projects ideas, applications, some tutorials, a blog and a YouTube channel too.

Have a read :

Last two tips for you

1. If you are unable to decide with the 4 resources I mentioned in my link, go with Automate the boring stuff with python book which is available online for free. Though I still like you to explore remaining three too.
2. Don't think about best resource or don't go after too many resources. Stick to 1–2 and take your time.

I wish you all the best in your journey.

Remember it won't be easy in start, but once you get the ignition, rest of the journey will be smooth.

Can I learn Python in 1 month?,"You can certainly learn the language syntax and the basics. However, if you do not have any programming experience, 1 month is not enough to become a programmer, no matter what the language.

There are design patterns, best practices to address certain issues, and of course common pitfalls, both language independent and language specific.

Plus, knowing your way around in a language also means not having to re-invent the wheel, i.e, knowing the most widely used modules to reuse.

Knowing a language, to me, does not mean that I can implement anything I will need during my software project, but that I know what I do not need to implement myself, or how I can integrate existing modules and add add my own business logic on top to create a solution to a specific problem quickly, and keep the solution lightweight at the same time.

Can I learn Python in a month?,"Claim: You can’t learn Python in one month.

Proof: If you can grok this extract in five minutes then yes, by all means you can learn Python programming in one month. But even reading this answer will take more than five minutes (let alone learning and practicing it), so we conclude that Python cannot be learnt in one month.

What if you’re an experienced programmer? Then you’d not have asked this question. ;)

Chapter 0

What do you think will be the result of dividing 7 over 5? Will it be a whole number or a decimal? In Python, a whole number is called an Integer (hereafter referred to as int) whereas a decimal is called a Float.

[code]7 / 5
%3E 1.4
[/code]What about 10/5? Will the result be an int?

[code]10 / 5
%3E 2.0
[/code]To our surprise, int division produced a float result. If we wanted to produce an int division, we should have done this:

[code]10 // 5
%3E 2
[/code]The // is called floor division. here’s why:

[code]6 // 4
%3E 1
[/code]Because floor division must produce integers, whatever is fractional or decimal is cut down. In the case above, the mathematical answer should have been 1.5, but since // produces only an int, the 0.5 part was truncated, leaving only the 1.

Along the same topic, we also have % for remainder. If you divide 16 over 5, the result is 3, but the remainder is 1. In Python, % means mod or modulus, and it works like this:

[code]16 % 3
%3E 1
[/code]The rest of the operations are:

[code]1 * 2 
%3E 2

4 - 2 
%3E 2

(4 + 5) * 8
%3E 72

# raising to a power is done with **

2**3
%3E 8
[/code]You must have noticed a comment (about raising to a power with **) that started with #. In programming, we write short comments within the code, so that we our future selves or others whose task is to read our code can make sense of some tricky and not immediately-obvious parts of our program. In Python, one-line comments start with #.

So far, we’ve used the numbers freely. As soon as we computed some mathematical expression, the task was done. Sometimes, however, we need to save numbers in containers that should interact with other containers to produce increasingly-complex results.

A container is merely a name that contains the data type—here a number—within itself.

For instance, let’s measure some cube. The cube’s height is 30 cm and its width is 15 cm, whereas its length is 40 cm.

Thus, we have three containers here: height, length and width. In python, locking a number within a container is called assignment. When you assign 10 to [code ]width[/code], you can then use width instead of typing 15 each time. Normally, a container is called a variable and that’s what we’ll say too.

Given the three variables, we can now compute the cube’s “Volume”. Then we can save (assign) the result to a variable called [code ]volume[/code].

[code]height = 30
width  = 10
length = 40

volume = height * width * length
[/code]So now that we have [code ]volume[/code], what can we do with it? In programming, the ‘verb’ which is something we do with variables goes by many names depending on the language. In Python, and more generally even, this is called a function.

A function does something useful and can be already existing in Python—called built-in—or it can be made from scratch by us. Note that each function has a unique name and you must never assign to a custom function you wrote, a name that belongs to a built-in function.

Suppose we wanted to inspect the contents of [code ]volume[/code]. The built-in function [code ]print[/code] will be enough:

[code]print(volume)
%3E 12000
[/code]You also notice that our function print has an opening and a closing parenthesis. All functions in Python have this, even when there’s nothing inside them. The thing inside the function’s parenthesis is called function argument, and if it exists, then we can say a function will be a transitive verb whereas a function argument will be the object of that verb: in other words, the function “does” what it’s supposed to do “to” the function argument.

In the jargon, we say “call a function” instead of using a function, and adding an argument to a function is referred to as “passing an argument to a function”.

Here is another built-in function: round(). It’s purpose is to round a decimal number. For instance, 900.9558 rounded to two decimals can be written as:

[code]round(900.9558, 2)
%3E 900.96
[/code]Now we will turn to the last item before we have a scaffolding in place to jump into programming: strings.

Simply, a string is something that is not considered a number and it is usually a letter, word, or a sentence. In Python, we use single or double quotes to represent a string. Here are some examples of strings:

[code]""j""
""Jan""
""I am Jan Meww, and you?""
""39""
[/code]Note that “39” is not a number or not considered a number because of being enclosed in quotes. The main thing that differentiates a number from a string is this: when you type a number in the console (interactive session), Python will automatically accept it as a number, but if you type a word or a letter, Python will throw or declare an error.

Now you’re ready. If you recall from high school, a Fibonacci sequence is sequence of numbers such, that as long as our number is more than 1, the next number is a sum of the previous two:

[math]0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5[/math]

Thus, [math]0+1 = 1, 1+1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3,  2 + 3 = 5,  3 + 5 = 8[/math], and [math]5 + 8 = 13[/math] and onwards. Note, as we add [math]1 + 2 = 3[/math], we take the two numbers on both sides of the equal sign and add them up: [math]2 + 3 = 5[/math]. Now the two numbers on both sides of the = are [math]3[/math] and [math]5[/math], so we add these up, and so forth.

Programming is giving well-defined instructions to a computer so that there are no ambiguities that might lead the computer to make a mistake. On the contrary, among humans, instructions can be ambiguous and still understood because our body language, tone, cultural references, and the context can provide plenty of cues to our minds.

There’s a well-known joke (well-known among programmers, though) about this:


%3E A woman asks her husband, a programmer, to go shopping:

-Dear, please, go to the nearby grocery store to buy some bread. Also, if they have eggs, buy a dozen.

-OK, hun.

Twenty minutes later the husband comes back bringing 12 loaves of bread.

His wife is flabbergasted:

-Why on earth did you buy a dozen loaves of bread?

-They had eggs
The joke reflects how computers think and how programmers are affected by that precise level of thinking. This is not such a bad thing as the joke implies; in fact, the art of providing clear, concise instruction to a computer will sharpen your brain and also fine-tune it to detect weak arguments.

The problem in the above joke is that the wife said: “if they have eggs, buy a dozen”. For humans it is easy to see that the comma in the sentence above implies that the dozen is connected to the eggs, but computers cannot infer commas. A computer deals with sentences and instructions as they are, which makes it a little difficult to get used to at first.

Recasting the same joke to make a computer understand it as we do should have resulted in:

“if they have eggs, then in addition to buying some bread, buy a dozen eggs, too”.

Even this has a problem, because the computer won’t buy bread if the shop did not have eggs. We can rephrase it:

“First, buy some bread. Then, if they have eggs, buy a dozen eggs, too.”

Now this is unambiguous.

Returning to the Fibonacci, our Fibonacci sequence is well-defined because it contains no ambiguities and the computer can make sense of it; we say “take two numbers [code ]a[/code] and [code ]b[/code], turn [code ]a[/code] to [code ]b[/code], and turn [code ]b[/code] to [code ]a+b[/code]”. And most likely we will also add a stopping point so that it does not go on forever: “continue to do this up to some limit.”

How would we write this as code? We need a proper way to inform Python that we want to add the previous two numbers and present them in a sequence. This requires a loop.

A loop is a programming concept that can be approximately called a “do this during this duration”. One loop we will see now is called [code ]while[/code]. So let’s first see this program and then dissect it:

[code]a, b = 0, 1
while a %3C 20:
	a, b = b, a+b
	print(a)
[/code]You will have noticed that we can assign several variables at the same time. We assigned [math]0[/math] to [code ]a[/code] and [math]1[/math] to[code ] b[/code] at the same time, separated by a comma. Next, we instruct Python that as long as [code ]a[/code] is less than [math]20[/math], do the following tasks. The colon at the end of [math]20[/math] is represents the concept of “following tasks”.

Another thing you noticed after the colon is that the code automatically will go 4 spaces to the right (in most Python editors it does this automatically. If it does not, you have to do this manually yourself, but in practice this is done automatically to prevent errors in miscalculated spaces).

More specifically, this spacing is called indentation, and the four-space indentation is unique only to Python; because Python cares about the white space around the code, the core idea behind indentation is to make the code easier on the eyes, especially if we have long pages of code.

Next, as long as [code ]a[/code] is less than [math]20[/math], we will start by assigning the value of [code ]b[/code] to [code ]a[/code], and the value of[code ] a+b[/code] to [code ]b[/code]. This is very similar to adding the two numbers on the two sides of the = sign I showed earlier. If [code ]a[/code] was [math]2[/math] and [code ]b[/code] was [math]3[/math], then the next [code ]a[/code] will be [math]3[/math] whereas the next [code ]b[/code] will be [math](2+3)[/math] or [math]5[/math]. Thus, for the next round, the next [code ]a[/code] will change from [math]3[/math] and become [math]5[/math], while the next [code ]b[/code] will become [math](3+5)[/math] or [math]8[/math], and so forth.

Finally, we also instruct Python to display all the values that [code ]a[/code] takes during its [code ]while[/code] journey:

Now that you’re exposed to the [code ]while[/code] loop, another important foundation concept is the conditional; in Python, the conditional is [code ]if[/code], and acts like “if” as humans use it. Suppose I am 40 years old, and one of my acquaintances is Python. If we were to ask Python whether Jan is 40, we would make use of [code ]==[/code] which stands for ‘equal to’. Let’s see what Python says about this:

[code]# first we make sure Jan is 40
jan = 40

# then we check whether this is really so
jan == 40
%3E true
[/code]Python agrees. What about:

[code]Jan == 40
[/code]Will it evaluate to [code ]true[/code] as well? No, because variable names are case-sensitive. jan and Jan are not the same thing.

I also want to mention that assigning a value to a variable, say:

[code]Meww = 40
[/code]And then assigning 39 to Meww will result in Meww becoming 39, because that is the last value we assigned to Meww; A container can only contain one value and when we assign 39 to Meww, 40 has to go. (so that 39 can take its place.)

But go where? Python automatically clears the space for the newly assigned 39, and 40 goes to the virtual ‘thrash can’. In the jargon, this is called automatic garbage collection, a concept Python borrowed from Lisp. (And not all languages have this.)

Next, you will see an error that was caused by mistyping. This is the most frequent cause of beginner level mistakes in code:

As you can see, Jann is something unrecognized by Python, and it will mention this to us in its error message, even though, Python’s error messages are rather cryptic.

Now, let’s use the conditional[code ] if[/code]. If Jan is 40, Python should say something more than true; perhaps we can ask it to say: “Congrats, you’re still young!”:

[code]Jan = 40
if Jan == 40:
	print(“Congrats, you’re still young!”)
[/code]That is it. Now what happens if Jan is not 40? We can also insert additional conditional clauses in there: suppose we wanted this: if Jan is 40 then print “hoorah” and if Meww is 39, then print “congrats”.

[code]Jan, Meww = 40, 39
if Jan == 40:
	print(""hoorah!"")
if Meww == 39:
	print(""congrats!"")
[/code]The conditional does not stop there. We can add further conditions. Suppose you instruct your robot to go to the Mall and buy milk and eggs. You could say something like this:

[code]# define the variables:

eggs = ""eggs""
bread = ""bread""

if eggs == true:
	buy(eggs)
else:
	buy(bread)
[/code]First, we instruct the robot to recognize eggs and bread when it sees them. In the solution space—which is the page where we write our Python code—this means assigning strings “eggs” and “bread” to the variables of the same name, so that we can use those names directly, without attaching quotes to them each time. This enhances readability but also prevents errors.

Next, we add a conditional which is the equivalent of “if eggs are available in the Mall”. In Python, existence and availability is synonymous with [code ]true[/code]. If something is [code ]true[/code], then it exists and can be used.

The final step was instructing the robot what to do; we learned earlier that doing something was a function, and functions look like this: [code ]function(argument)[/code] if transitive but also [code ]function()[/code] if intransitive. While the syntax of our code above is correct, the function [code ]buy(something)[/code] is not already defined in Python, and the robot will not recognize it. Thus, we will also have to define—create—this function and include correct and clear instructions in the body of this function so that Python can execute it according to our wishes.

A function is made with a keyword [code ]def[/code], a function name, and a body. Here the function name is [code ]greet[/code], and the body’s task is to say “Hello!”.

Like so:

[code]def greet():
	print(""Hello!"")
[/code]This is an argumentless function (intransitive), so when we call (access or put it to use) it, it must also be argumentless:

[code]greet()
%3E Hello!
[/code]We can also make functions that take arguments—what I earlier termed transitive. Suppose the robot will greet by name. Thus, the name of the person it greets is the argument:

[code]def greet(name):
	print(""Hello!"", name)
[/code]Let’s see it in action:

[code]greet(""Jan"")
%3E Hello! Jan
[/code]Note that the placeholder argument [code ]name[/code] must be a string, since names are made of letters—and not numbers. This is why Jan was written as [code ]“Jan”[/code]. But we could have done this too:

[code]greet(5)
%3E Hello! 5
[/code]This is both a strength and a weakness in Python but beyond the scope of this post. Consider this, though: in certain languages, like Julia, argument type can be specified at the time we define a function, but as of this writing, not in Python.

So when you define

[code]def greet(name):
  print(""hi"", name)
[/code]In Python, you cannot force-specify what type of input name could be. This leads to more flexibility as you saw earlier, but also to potentially hidden bugs or errors.

Finally, note the comma between name and “Hello!”. This is the first time you see [code ]print()[/code] taking two arguments separated by a comma. However, the ability of a function to take n arguments is restricted by its construction.

Thus, [code ]print()[/code] is built-in and constructed to take more than one argument, whereas [code ]greet()[/code] is not because we only passed [code ]name[/code] as the maximum number of arguments it should accept.

How did you do? How long did it take?

How do I learn Python by myself?,"One of the things that I found most frustrating when I was learning Python was how generic all the learning resources were. It seemed like every learning resource wanted me to spend 2 long, boring, months on Python syntax before I could even think about doing what interested me.

I believe that the first step in learning any programming language is making sure that you understand how to learn. Learning how to learn is arguably the most critical skill involved in computer programming.

Lets take this code snippet for example :

[code]from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request): 
	return HttpResponse(""Hello, world. You're at the polls index."")
[/code]Experienced programmers will often throw snippets like the above at you. ""It's easy!"", they'll promise. But even a few seemingly simple lines of code can be incredibly confusing. For instance, why are some lines indented? What's [code ]django.http[/code]? Why are some things in parentheses? Understanding how everything fits together when you don't know much Python can be very hard.

The problem is that you need to understand the building blocks of the Python language to build anything interesting.Most tutorials assume that you need to learn all of Python syntax before you can start doing anything interesting. This is what leads to months spent just on syntax, when what you really want to be doing is analyzing data, or building a website, or creating an autonomous drone

Here are some tips to help you make the new concepts you are learning as a beginner programmer really stick:

1. Code Everyday : Consistency is very important when you are learning a new language. We recommend making a commitment to code every day. It may be hard to believe, but muscle memory plays a large part in programming. Committing to coding everyday will really help develop that muscle memory. Though it may seem daunting at first, consider starting small with 25 minutes everyday and working your way up from there.
2. Go Interactive : Whether you are learning about basic Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.) for the first time, or you are debugging an application, the interactive Python shell will be one of your best learning tools.
3. Build Something, Anything : For beginners, there are many small exercises that will really help you become confident with Python, as well as develop the muscle memory that we spoke about above. Once you have a solid grasp on basic data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, sets), object-oriented programming , and writing classes, it’s time to start building!What you build is not as important as how you build it. The journey of building is truly what will teach you the most. You can only learn so much from reading Real Python articles and courses. Most of your learning will come from using Python to build something. The problems you will solve will teach you a lot.There are many lists out there with ideas for beginner Python projects. Here are some ideas to get you started:
4. 
1. Number guessing game
2. Simple calculator app
3. Dice roll simulator

5. Contribute to Open Source : In the open-source model, software source code is available publicly, and anyone can collaborate. There are many Python libraries that are open-source projects and take contributions. Additionally, many companies publish open-source projects. This means you can work with code written and produced by the engineers working in these companies.
6. Take Breaks : When you are learning, it is important to step away and absorb the concepts.you work for 25 minutes, take a short break, and then repeat the process. Taking breaks is critical to having an effective study session, particularly when you are taking in a lot of new information.Breaks are especially important when you are debugging. If you hit a bug and can’t quite figure out what is going wrong, take a break. Step away from your computer, go for a walk .In programming, your code must follow the rules of a language and logic exactly, so even missing a quotation mark will break everything. Fresh eyes make a big difference.
Hope that helps :)

Can I learn the Python programming language in one month?,"See, Python is one of the easiest and most popular languages. If python is your first programming language then it will take around 1 month( min 3 hrs a day ). But if you already know any language then it will be easy for you. It would take hardly around 2 weeks.

It also depends on your learning method. If you take some course then they have a predefined time limit for the course.

Can I learn Python in less than three months?,"You can learn the syntax of Python in a few days.

But Learning to use a language is more than just learning the syntax: For example I know the ‘syntax’ of C++ (mostly) but I can’t code efficiently in C++ - I don’t have the practice or experience to do so.

Building a pool of experience that lets you be an efficient programmer in Python in 3 months is going to be tough - You will be needing to spend a lot time every day working on good quality exercises, and even then it will be tight.

if you already have development experience then it will be easier to hit your target, but if you are a fresh developer you will also be learning a host of other skills which aren’t Python specific: abstraction, decomposition, change control, testing, documentation to name but a few.

Also remember the power of Python often comes from the use of the powerful libraries such as numpy, pandas, Django, Tensorflow and many others. having experience with those is a big project in its own right. it took me nearly 3 months to get my head around Django for example to the point where I could create a functional Website for a charity event.

"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","I've been learning python for about six months now. Not spending 8 hours a day on it but more as a hobby. 
I started less than a year ago with html, css and javascript. So I did start python with some solid knowledge on what code and programming is about. 
Of course, when starting python, I fell in love with the syntax and simplicity this language offers. It also allowed me to easily learn some complex programming concepts that I am able to use in other languages I sometimes have fun with (for example VBA). 
After six months of python I have had a few projects going on and here are the major things I worked on, chronologically:

1. I created a bot that plays an online game for me. It works recognizing images on the screen and clicking where appropriate. This was a great experience as it was the first ""big"" program I ever wrote.
2. Raspberry pi: working on this one with my brother. We have had different projects. Starting from lighting up lights to a self driving car:
1. ​

​​​our next goal with this one is to add a camera and be able to control the car from a website.
2. OpenPyxl: I use a lot of Excel for work. VBA is a great language but I like being able to do things through python, completely in the dark and once I open excel it magically copied and compared data from different files. So many things happen ""underneath"" that I haven't been able to do with VBA.
3. Django: is what I try to focus on the most more recently. If I want to one day work in the tech industry I believe Web Development is the best route for me to start in. Django is really powerful and starts making sense (I have to say the beginning seemed a little overwhelming because there are a lot of things that need to be understood, as well as the links between those things) to me. I think the fact I started with html, css and javascript is really going to help me out in Django projects so I'm looking forward to the future things I will create.
After 6 months I'm pretty happy with the python level I have reached. I hope I'll manage to double this knowledge in the next six months. And be able to apply as much as possible in my day to day life (current job, personal apps, other projects) on order to keep it as exciting as it has been.

I hope this answer gives you an idea of what the next few months might look like for you.",https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it’s-their-first-language?top_ans=20000613,2016-02-27T09:25:40.219988+00:00,2020-06-07T10:48:17.656062+00:00,1464,Pierre Corbin,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pierre-Corbin
How long does it take to learn Python?,"For me it took 3 months! and 219 Pomodoro!

My status before I started:

 * I don’t have any programming background at all.
 * I’m bad at math.
 * I Don’t know what's algoritmes.
 * I don’t know how to learn!
My advice for you:

You need to have two main things: a purpose and to be patient as a mountain! Also, do not rely on your passion or feelings. Because they come and go randomly. Instead, rely on continuous work.

Additionally, you need to learn how to learn! This is very important if you want to be a fast learner. There is a free short course titled Learning how to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects. And if you want to go farther there is also a book called A mind for numbers. Read also chapter 3 from a book called soft skills by John Sonmez about learning. Plus there is a nice youtube video, The first 20 hours. You may want to have a look at it.

Furthermore, you need to vary your resource learning. I mean you need to try learning from many materials like online courses, books, youtube series tutorials, practicing solo!

My experience to learn Python

My purpose was weird! I needed to learn Python to learn java and start programming Android apps, because in the past I jumped to learn java in android platform, java was hell to me! Then I decided to learn an easier language together with the OOP (object-oriented programming principles). Including math and algorithms, it took me three months.

Now I start to learn java and it seems more easier than before (long code but easier in understanding and memories). I’m on my way to seek the Pythonic road! I don’t know why I should still learn Python but this language is addictive :)",https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it’s-their-first-language?top_ans=24338276,2016-06-25T07:31:46.051679+00:00,2017-04-23T05:27:12.023127+00:00,1113,Anonymous,
"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","I recently finished creating a course that teaches the fundamentals of Python in 30 days while building a real working software program, even with zero prior experience. So with that context in mind…

I would say that it shouldn’t take more than a month to learn the basics of variables, functions/methods, if statements, loops, and that kind of stuff. Oh and when I say a month I mean 30 days of doing a little bit each day.

With that being said, “learn” is a loaded word. You see, programming is a skill, not a fact or something like that.

How well you’ve learned comes down to how well you can display and execute the skill of programming in Python.

All programming skill comes down to one simple idea - creating working software. A skilled programmer creates working software. The greater your skill, the more likely that it works reliably well and with few bugs.

In a month, you can learn enough to be able to build simple working software programs. But, it takes years to develop enough skill to program anything you can imagine and with few bugs.

There is a desire by many people reading this question to find the shortcut and learn to code as quickly as possible. After devoting over 20 years of my life to writing software, I’m still learning new things and improving my skills.

Instead of wasting time trying to learn to code and get a job in 30, 60, 90 days as is so popular of a sales pitch for bootcamps and so on, give yourself YEARS of investment in this craft.

If you practiced Python and wrote software every day for the next 365 days, you’d be dramatically better than you are right now. I don’t know how good you’ll be in a week or a month, but a year of daily practice produces remarkable results.

Now extrapolate that to a decade.

How good can you be if you write code every day for the next 3,652 days? You’d be a coding rockstar.

Truth be told, probably fewer than 5% of programmers in the world deliberately practice their craft on a daily basis. Instead they get to a reasonable enough level to do their job and they stop learning.

So, if you build the habit of writing code every day, you can learn faster than the other 95% of coders. And over the course of a career, that becomes a remarkable advantage.

It doesn’t matter how long it will take. Just write code every day and you’ll get there.

There. You have now ‘learned’ Python. Feel free to now destroy the Internet with your hacking skills.

Oh, you want to know about objects and classes? How about iterables? Python coding conventions? More importantly, do you want to know why all the above works, and not just that it works in some magical way?

It’s difficult to say when you’ve “learned” a language, per se. With the information above, you can probably get away with coding some very straightforward stuff pretty easily.

In actuality, I’d say it will take you a few weeks, if you’re dedicated, to truly wrap your head around all the most important and fundamental programming concepts. This includes variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, recursion and the basics of object oriented programming.

How you go about learning programming depends on how you learn best, but should definitely include some practical work. Codecademy’s Python course is an excellent option, as is Learn Python the Hard Way; both of these free online tutorials involve lots of practical work, and will give you the knowledge you need to get your feet off the ground and start coding more independently. In any case, do some small projects as you work to make sure you’re internalizing the programming knowledge you read or watch.

Happy coding!",https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it’s-their-first-language?top_ans=27004941,2016-08-26T17:40:26.642990+00:00,,152,Jack Romo,https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Romo
How long did it take you to master Python?,"It took me 4 hours (four hours) to write my first, very simple working program (a very simple file-system maintenance tool).

It took me one week (one week) to write the first, small program actually used by the company I was working at that time (a small “devops” tool).

It took me 3 to 6 months (three to six months) to experiment each and every “dark corner” of the language and a large part of its standard library (Python was at version 1.X at that time. Python 3 is significantly larger and more complex).

It will took me forever to actually master it and to explore all of the available libraries.

I was already a Perl, Javascript, and Basic developer when I started to use Python. Using Python when you already know Perl is trivial.

For what I have seen in the last 20 years, an individual with absolutely no prior programming knowledge can usually learn the basics of Python (studying it alone, using web resources) and write his/her first Python program in a week or two and can become proficient in the language in one to three months (just the language, no frameworks and libraries like Django or TensorFlow).

Becoming proficient in a Python-based framework, like Django, can take from three to six months, no matter if you already know Python.",https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it’s-their-first-language?top_ans=151676191,2019-07-03T14:53:22.420688+00:00,,104,Alessandro Bottoni,https://www.quora.com/profile/Alessandro-Bottoni
"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","As a first programming language? Hm…

Maybe 2 weeks.

However™

Learning python won’t do you much good by itself. Its not syntax which needs to be important to you. Its the way a programmer thinks and acts to solve everyday problems.

You need to start learning how to break down a problem into multiple steps, solve each one efficiently, and be able to apply those steps across any language, including python.

Once you understand the concepts of thinking like a programmer, Python isn't hard to learn at all. Its very simple and quite elegant, its one of my favorite languages actually.

You’ll need to learn basic syntax like if/elif/else, while and for loops, print statements, functions, etc. Then you can play around with some of the cooler things in python like lists, modules, etc. After that I have one word:

Practice.

Build, create, design, optimize, do this over and over and over again until every letter of python code is hard wired into your head. Every time you learn something new, try it out on your own, using your own style. Make little choose your own adventure games using if/elif/else. Make calculators using raw_input and int() statements. Not only will you learn python, you’ll know how to use it in a way thats good.

Now, simply learning the language to be fairly comfortable will only take 2–3 weeks. Practicing with it, learning how to make it a weapon something you can use with precise accuracy and efficient skills. That could take much longer.

I encourage you to continue down this path of learning, programming really is the closest thing humans have to a superpower. Its a lot of fun and I wish you good luck.

Cheers!",https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it’s-their-first-language?top_ans=36085526,2017-02-04T17:20:08.178543+00:00,,119,Aiden Calvert,https://www.quora.com/profile/Aiden-Calvert-2
In how much time can I learn Python?,"Umm.. let me first tell you about programming languages. Actually programming languages are just a tool to implement programming concepts. Learning a programming language like python, is just learning a kind of syntax to implement programming concepts. How much time will it take to learn python depends on how much you know about programming!

If you have had experience with some other programming languages it’ll not take more than 3–4 days to understand the python syntax. Well, in case if you're new to programming it may take some time to delve into this field to learn all sorts of operations, manipulations and other concepts. With python, I think it’ll be good to begin learning programming. This language resembles the English language making it less cryptic to eyes and a lot easier to understand.

I cannot blindly make a guess about the time to learn it, as it also depends on you, how much time you devote everyday and also what your end-goal is. With end-goal what I am referring to is, what you wanna achieve after learning python. Python is such a great language that it has its application almost everywhere. From simple desktop apps to data-analysis and machine-learning, python has purely become a general purpose language.

Personally, I love python and would always suggest beginners to start with this. It's easier to learn, you might find it more interesting than C or C++, they somewhat bring nightmares for beginners although they are wonderful too.

Again, how much time will it take, it all depends on you. A fair guess, if you just want to get a hang of some basic functionality and data structures, it would take around a month or so. Now when you're done with basics you are ready to choose your path towards your end-goal whether it's web development, data science, machine learning or what not!

"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","Inspired by my friend, who told me that Python is a fantastic programming language, I start learning Python last summer holiday.

At the very beginning, I found it very funny that I can directly test my code in a REPL shell(I am a C programmer before, and I need to compile my code before running). This feature really impress me.

So I have a faith in learning Python. I read the book ‘Learning Python(4th Edition)’ patiently, change by chapter. This book is both good for a programmer or a freshman to study Python, because it covers the fundamental knowledge of programming and advanced knowledge.

The author gives some cases in the book, and I try to follow his step by typing the code, running the program and debugging until I get the same result as it should be.

After reading most chapters of the book, I start using Python to do something interesting.

 * Rename multi files
 * Grab my test score from school’s website, and inform me by email.
 * do Nature Language Processing
 * File server
 * and so many things….
This stage is the best time to enhance your understanding to Python. You find a problem and you try to fix the problem in a Pythonic way,

Recently, I am building my own blog using Flask and MongoDB. Although it's not very easy for me to complete such a project right now, I do improve my Python skill now(syntax, programming criteria, the ability to solve problem)

In conclusion, the best way to learn Python is:

1. Practice
2. Create Problem
3. Solve Problem
4. Review Ofiicial Document.

How long did it take you to master Python?,"1 month: OK, I’ve completed the Codecademy course on Python, I now know the language.

3 months: Oh, there’s more modules that come in Python by default, I should probably look at those modules, some of them might be helpful.

6 months: What is functools useful for? It’s just a copy of builtin behaviors.

1 year: Oh, generator expressions are a thing? That’s what you use functools for.

2 years: I think I have finally mastered Python! Wait, what do you mean, concurrency?

So yeah, there’s a short story of my learning python. I’ve been at it for a few years by now, and I still haven’t “mastered” python.

"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","It depends on the newbie involved, but since Python was one of my first exposures to programming I think my experience might be indicative. I already knew Matlab somewhat, so the concept of variables and control loops wasn't a totally alien concept to me. However, the syntax was very different than Matlab so it was different enough that I put some effort in. I think I learned the basics of the language over a two week period and at that point was proficient enough that I could write the kinds of programs a ""newbie"" would be expected to be able to write. From there I continued to practice and maybe after three months I was able to use Python in a few research projects I was working on in a university lab I was working in during the summer. Again, it wasn't anything crazy, mostly just data cleaning and a few transformations, but I felt comfortable with programming concepts and with the language itself.

Based on that, I'd say that if you devote maybe an hour or two a day to it, you could have a decent feel for the language after a month if it's your first language. If you're already familiar with programming concepts, I expect you'll pick it up ever faster. The great thing about Python is that it writes and looks very much like pseudocode so you don't get bogged down in boilerplate just to print ""Hello, world"".

I will say, though, that I only mean you'll be able to understand some of the built in functions and the general features of the language. To be a truly competent developer in any language you need experience with all the third party packages that enable you to do so much more than you would otherwise. If you want to be able write real code (more than the kinds of things you'd see in tutorials), then you'll need to be putting in work for at least a few months.",https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it’s-their-first-language?top_ans=20011750,2016-02-27T18:13:58.030266+00:00,,35,Steven Helferich,https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-Helferich
"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","Learning a new programming language can be intimidating. In this technological era, programming knowledge is not a want but a need if you want to fit in the current job market. Out of all the programming languages I’ve come across, I found Python to be the easiest. Nonetheless, it does not mean that learning this language won’t be challenging. Generally speaking, it takes about 4-5 months to master the language in theory. But until you put it into practice, be it through projects or small tasks/assignments, you won’t be able to perfect those skills.

If your only aim is to learn the language, I would recommend Sololearn. It is one of the best platforms if you want to learn to code. They’ll start from the basics and cover many topics necessary for programming in Python.

Your future after learning the python language holds two paths. You can either enter the software development field or become a data scientist. Considering the hype around the Data Science industry, with the proper knowledge and skills, you can enter and flourish in this field in no time.

Claiming a successful career in Data Science is a long shot. But the right direction can take you miles ahead. Through the data science courses, you can start from scratch and learn about Statistics, Python and R programming, and other concepts related to data science.

A platform that caught my eye is 1stepGrow. Through much research, it fits all the requirements that would be expected from a good data science course. The three most intriguing things I found about this course are:

 * The classes are 100% live and interactive, meaning you will get to interact with the trainers. This is expected to boost confidence and interest in the subject.
 * They offer profile building. Their profile-building strategy is meant to create a strong background for your experience profile to help you stand out from the crowd of other candidates.
 * They offer project experience certificates accredited by top companies, a certificate from IBM, and a course completion certificate.
There are various other platforms as well, but most of them have a recorded session mode of delivery which I don’t find quite beneficial because I feel learning through pre-recorded sessions has a negative impact on concentration and interest in the subject.

In any case, I highly recommend you look for courses that offer what you require and choose the best one.

There’s a lot to learn about any language, but the basics of python are so obvious that you may guess some of them without looking them up.

the language is a miracle - there isn’t another language like it in the world. it is regarded as the fastest language for software development purposes, because everything falls into place like magic. it’s object oriented programming without all the crap.

the language works with you, not against you. as soon as you use python, you realize that all your life you’ve been telling computers how to do things they should have been able to figure out for themselves, and it’s 90% of all the code you’ve typed.

getting a range from an array is like array[15:30]

and getting every other item of it would be array[15:30:2]

you get input with variable = input(“enter text: “)

and you print it with print(variable)

and you never import anything, or instantiate anything, or inherit anything, while performing these simple tasks.

but when you want to import something, you do it with import something whether it’s part of python, a library you installed by simply copying it from your downloads folder to your python directory, or any file in the same directory you’re in, it just works.

everything just works.

"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","Computing and programming are mostly about abstraction and code. Most of the time you'll be transforming data from its existing state to its desired state and translating expert/business knowledge into rules / heuristics that computers can follow.

You get to build complex things as many layers of less complex components. You also need to find viable and efficient ways of representing the relevant properties of things in terms of properties of abstractions you already have, that's the ""codification"" part. E.g: a person's gender gets represented as an 'M' or 'F' ASCII character in a CHAR field of relation table or each player in a MMO game gets represented by a single process in an application server cluster.

That's why in computer programming we are always talking about ""platforms"" since we're generally building custom/specific solutions on top of existing general/horizontal ones and we call this solutions ""applications"" since we are applying a generic technology to an specific problem. 

Having said that you'll be much more competent as a technologist / developer if you are familiar with a large number of the layers / components / platforms / frameworks   involved in the building process and life-cycle management of your product.

If someone is already reasonably-competent with a high-level scripting language like Javascript or PHP, has a basic but good understanding of the Object-Oriented principles, knows the ways around installing software in a computer, knows the basic of SQL and relational databases, has a basic idea of networking in a Internet setup and understands at least the basics of a network protocol like HTTP or TCP sockets I think he or she could be writing reasonably good Python web apps, simple IoT projects or automating operations stuff at a commercial level in matter of weeks, with viable prototypes even in days.

 For someone who needs to pick the basics of programming at the same time and then learn their way around the minimum set  of skills to work with a Linux-based VPS on the cloud, work with a relational database, get started with networking protocols, learn to use OOP effectively and all sort of basic computer science skills required to put together viable products we're talking months full time, possible a couple of years part-time or on weekends. This does require a lot of persistence, help from friends, peers or people from the internet and specially very good instincts to work around problems.

How much time will it take for a beginner to learn Python?,"Unlike other students/ professionals, I had to learn python within a month, that too during my semesters, last year(I had a project). I had learned C++ in school, and Java after 12 board exams.

Now, the answer(the introduction was necessary…). If you want to learn via tutorial videos, you can goto sites like Coursera, Code Academy, etc. The average time required will around 1 month. The next way is to read and do practicals(I did this way). Tutorialspoint provides pdfs for a lot of programming languages, including basics, data-structures, etc. Or by LearnPython.

How long does it take to learn Python?,"Sounds like you are setting out to learn at least 2 things. the Python language, and computer programming. The Python language is reasonably compact and quite self-consistent. A few weeks study, if you already know programming in, say, Java, should be quite sufficient to know the language, but there's quite a bit more for you to learn. When I took Udacity CS101, it was nominally 8 weeks long. I understand they have since expanded it and now call it a 3-month course.

In my opinion, it's a great introductory course. See Is the Udacity CS101 course watered down? [ http://rdrewd.blogspot.com/2012/12/is-udacity-cs101-course-watered-down.html ]

"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","Learning the general fundamentals and functions of Python, for a newbie would generally take 2-3 months. However, it is important to stay consistent during this period if you actually want to find significant results.

It also depends on the method that you are using to learn the python programming language. Self-study usually takes longer than when you learning from a training institute. Moreover, through a training institute, you get the right guidance and an adequate amount of appropriate projects to work on. If you wish, I would love to recommend a few online platforms that offer such courses.

Firstly, you need to figure out your path. Are you wishing to just learn the language and stop there? Or do you want to use the language in the real world as a software developer, data scientist, etc?

If you choose the first one, then platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Sololearn would be an excellent choice to consider. These platforms offer courses specifically designed to learn a programming language along with a few tasks or assignments.

If you plan on taking this newly learned language to the next level and using it in the real world for various uses, then you must go for other platforms than the ones mentioned above. Due to my interest in the data science field, I would like to guide you in this direction. Python is most used in the data science field to get meaning out of data. This language provides plenty of libraries that allow you to work with numbers efficiently and even use it to visually understand the data patterns. If your core interest lies in the data science field as well, then platforms like upGrad, Simplilearn, 1stepGrow, etc. will be of great help to you.

However, the main drawback of upGrad and Simplilearn is that they provide pre-recorded video sessions rather than live classes, which, in my opinion, has a poor impact on a student’s concentration in the subject. Moreover, the courses provided by them are a bit on the expensive side.


%3E Now, these opinions are completely subjective and if you aren’t bothered by them, I would recommend checking out the courses on the two platforms.
For the above reasons, I usually recommend 1stepGrow as an excellent choice when planning to learn data science using python. This is an ed-tech platform that offers courses in the fields of data science, data analytics, and digital marketing. It follows the concept of growing onestep at a time which is quite innovative to me. A few of its course features are:

 * The course provides 400 hours of 100% live training sessions. Live sessions provide room for an effective learning experience. It gives you the opportunity to have a healthy interaction with the trainers & fellow students and gain a clear understanding of the subject matter.
 * 25+ projects throughout the course along with at least 5 Capstone projects. In today’s world, having the right amount of real-time experience is all that companies look for in a candidate. Hence, these projects are going to help you get familiar with the industry.
 * At 1stepGrow, you get two types of certification:
 * 
 * Project Experience Certification from companies.
 * A course completion certificate from 1stepGrow and IBM.


%3E Having the right certification puts you on the right track in your career and helps you get noticed by a larger number of companies, hence, increasing your chances of getting hired.
 * 1stepGrow has a highly detailed curriculum allowing you to master and gain every necessary skill in the industry. Throughout the course, you will be given extensive knowledge of the tools used in the Data Science Industry. Here are a few of the tools that you will come across:
 * 
 * Python
 * R
 * AWS, GCP, Azure
 * Apache Spark
 * Hadoop
 * Apache Hive
 * SQL and NoSQL
 * MongoDB
 * Tableau and many more.

 * And, most importantly, 1stepGrow helps you build a strong profile with their profile building feature by helping you with project experience, and GitHub profile building, and along with this, they also help you build an excellent LinkedIn profile to help you get noticed by the best companies all over the world.
So this was all about the options you have when it comes to learning Python and the future associated with it. I would definitely recommend not just learning the language but actually implementing it in real life. I hope you find success in this new journey of yours!",https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it’s-their-first-language?top_ans=363575036,2022-06-22T04:30:39.666076+00:00,,10,Omkar Shinde,https://www.quora.com/profile/Omkar-Shinde-826
How do I learn Python?,"The most important question to answer first is why do I want to learn python? Answering this will guide what you use to learn and how you learn.

Starting with a very generic list of resources to learn python when you eventually want to make websites (for example), will not only reduce your motivation, it will also make it much harder to apply the knowledge you gain.  I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.

When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.

1.  Find what motivates you

Finding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.

Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.

Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.

Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:
 * Websites
 * Mobile apps
 * Games
 * Data science/Machine learning

2.  Learn some basic python syntax

Unless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.

For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.

Some resources that can help you:

 * Codecademy [ http://www.codecademy.com ] -- does a good job of teaching basic syntax.
 * Learn python the hard way [ http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ] -- a book that teaches a lot of python concepts.

 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] -- this is my startup.  It's focused on teaching python for data science, but it teaches all the basic syntax also.
 * The Python Tutorial [ https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ ] -- the tutorial on the main python site.

I can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.

3.  Make structured projects in your chosen area

Unless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.

When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:

Games
 * Codecademy  [ http://www.codecademy.com- ]-- walks you through making a couple of simple games.
 * Pygame tutorials [ http://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials ] -- pygame (the python library for making games) has a good list of tutorials
 * Making games with pygame [ http://www.amazon.com/Making-Games-Python-Pygame-Sweigart/dp/1469901730?ie=UTF8&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0982106017 ] -- this book looks like a great way to learn python by making games

Websites
 * Flask tutorial [ http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial/ ] -- the official flask (simple python web framework) tutorial.
 * Bottle tutorial [ http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html ] -- Bottle (even simpler web framework for python) tutorial. 

 * How To Tango With Django 1.7 [ http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/ ] -- a guide to using django (more complex python web framework)
Mobile apps
 * Kivy guide [ http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html-- ] -- Kivy is the tool that lets you make mobile apps with python.  They have a guide on how to get started.
Data science
 * Dataquest.io [ https://www.dataquest.io ] --  Teaches you python and data science interactively.  You analyze a series of interesting datasets ranging from CIA documents to NBA player stats.
 * Scikit-learn documentation [ http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html ] -- Scikit-learn (the main machine learning library for python) has some great documentation and tutorials.
 * Python for Data Analysis [ http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do ] -- written by the author of a major python data analysis library (pandas), it's a good introduction to analyzing data in python.

4.  Work on projects on your own

Once you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.

Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.

Some ideas:
 *  Extend the projects you were working on previously, and add more functionality.
 * Go to python meetups in your area, and find people who are working on interesting projects.
 * Find open source packages to contribute to.
 * See if any local nonprofits are looking for volunteer developers.
 * Find projects other people have made, and see if you can extend or adapt them.
My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.

The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.

5.  Keep working on harder projects

Keep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.

Here are some ideas for when that time comes:
 * Try teaching a novice how to do your current project.
 * Try load testing your website -- can you scale it up?
 * Can you make your program run faster?

Going forward

At the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it. 

You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.

Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",https://www.quora.com/On-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-newbie-to-learn-the-general-fundamentals-and-functions-of-Python-if-it’s-their-first-language?top_ans=13841814,2015-07-07T13:40:55.951227+00:00,,3046,Vik Paruchuri,https://www.quora.com/profile/Vik-Paruchuri

How long did it take you to master Python?,"It took me 4 hours (four hours) to write my first, very simple working program (a very simple file-system maintenance tool).

It took me one week (one week) to write the first, small program actually used by the company I was working at that time (a small “devops” tool).

It took me 3 to 6 months (three to six months) to experiment each and every “dark corner” of the language and a large part of its standard library (Python was at version 1.X at that time. Python 3 is significantly larger and more complex).

It will took me forever to actually master it and to explore all of the available libraries.

I was already a Perl, Javascript, and Basic developer when I started to use Python. Using Python when you already know Perl is trivial.

For what I have seen in the last 20 years, an individual with absolutely no prior programming knowledge can usually learn the basics of Python (studying it alone, using web resources) and write his/her first Python program in a week or two and can become proficient in the language in one to three months (just the language, no frameworks and libraries like Django or TensorFlow).

Becoming proficient in a Python-based framework, like Django, can take from three to six months, no matter if you already know Python.",https://www.quora.com/How-long-would-it-take-to-master-Python?top_ans=151676191,2019-07-03T14:53:22.420688+00:00,,104,Alessandro Bottoni,https://www.quora.com/profile/Alessandro-Bottoni
How long did it take you to master Python?,"I think your question could be more like 
Qn. How long can it take me to learn Python ?

Python Programming Language is referred to as the closest programming language to English because of its simplicity. If your coming from another programming language say Java you will notice this huge difference and affirm what im talking about.

Now to back to your question. This depends on so many factors but lets look briefly at the major ones.

1. Time. I consider Python to be one of the easiest and yet simplest language to learn but this factor has considerations in mind. for people who have been programming professionally it could take you less than a month to master the basics and alot more time to master the more complex stuff on average 6 months with intense training. For the beginners in programming i would say 6 months for the basics and way more time close to 2 yrs to master the complex stuff. That is just my own observation.

2. Interest/Willingness. Our levels of interest in programming languages are different and for that case people with more interest in the language will take much more less time to learn the language than ones that have less interest and taking the language as a joy-ride

3. Bias. Many people join programming with the bias that its hard and yet it isn't! and once your brain is tuned to that , trust me it will get much worse and take you much longer to learn Python or any Language than if you were confident to learn with a positive attitude. People with positive attitude not only towards programming but to all other challenges around us tend to thrive through them much more quickly than the ones that had a negative attitude/bias towards the challenge from the beginning.

In Conclusion, the period in which we learn new things depends greatly on the environment around us. Many things affect our progress but if we focus and have the right attitude, give time and persistence towards challenges, things will always take much lesser time than we anticipated.

Hope this helps shine the Light. “Programming is fun! Go for it”

How long did it take you to master Python?,"Before we start, let me quote - “You don’t choose Python, Python chooses you.”

I have been working in Python for more than 2 years now and I still think, I haven’t reached there to call myself a Python expert. Everyday Python slaps you in the face with a new concept. For instance, if you think you have mastered Inheritance then, my friend try implementing the multiple inheritance concept. So you knew about the multiple inheritance, fine. Did you try using new style classes? Oh, you look surprised now. Well that’s Python for you and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Python is a great language to start with and it really helps you grasp the coding concepts more easily if we compare it with the other languages. Python is evolving everyday and becoming one of the most used language in market. So, I’ll say you can become an expert within a year or two but to become a master you’ll have to spend more time for sure. You need to coil yourself around Python and it’s concept to master it (pun intended).",https://www.quora.com/How-long-would-it-take-to-master-Python?top_ans=92371684,2018-07-23T10:49:05.411657+00:00,,21,Himanshu Singh,https://www.quora.com/profile/Himanshu-Singh-2101

How long did it take you to master Python?,"I’ve programmed Python for over 20 years now, and I’m still learning a lot of new things. (Which I love. Standing still is boring.)

Programming in a programming language is not just one thing.

 * There is the actual syntax and semantics of the language. That part is simple.
 * Then there are idioms and understanding weak and strong spots etc. E.g. if you’re an old C programmer, you might quickly pick up the syntax and semantics and understand that a certain piece of Python code is the same as another piece of C code, and then you’ll write really bad Python, because you didn’t learn that you solve that problem you’re working with in a completely different way in Python than in C.
 * Finally, there are all the libraries, frameworks and tools, both the standard library and all third party stuff. You’ll never master all of this of course, and even if you think that you master some area you care about, you’ll notice that people write new stuff, so you’ll be busy keeping up with the development unless you want to stagnate.
I started using Python (1.4) late in 1996, initially to generate a static web site based on marked up text files. There was nothing like Jekyll or Pelican then. I think I was productive and creating value after a couple of days, but there was obviously a lot of things I didn’t know yet.

At that time I only used Python for some hobby stuff, and then I started to sneak it in at work, as a convenience tool for creating test data, checking things in the code, my personal time tracking etc. So I liked it, but I wasn’t paid to use it, even if I used it while paid…

In 2001 the internet market just plummeted, just as I was about to return from paternity leave, so I had more spare time, and started to help people in the places where people asked questions about Python in those days, long before Quora and Stack Overflow. I was competent enough to provide useful help to people, and it led to a contract where I wrote a substantial Python application with a GUI and an object database. This was five years after my first introduction to Python, but I could have done it sooner given the chance, and Python was mainly a hobby until then.",https://www.quora.com/How-long-would-it-take-to-master-Python?top_ans=66553073,2017-12-15T21:02:47.535147+00:00,,36,Anonymous,
How long did it take you to master Python?,"I would say it varies from one to one. One can’t definitely say you can be very much comfortable with python within 6 months or 6 weeks. In case of programming it is fully depends on your learning capability. If you are enjoying on a daily basis what you are learning thus will automatically boost up your level of confidence and will surely take less time to learn. Or in another case like most of the people, programming may seem to be boring one to you as level of dedication it takes to mastering in programming may not be presented in you. In that case, either it takes long period of time to learn programming or you may end up without learning any language.This is the overall scenario of learning any language.

Learning python, i must say is a very much smart approach as it is going to be the most powerful language not only in 2018 but also in upcoming years as the field of big data and data science are widely spreading. As it is comparatively easy to learn than other languages most of novices start their journey with this as i did.

It took me 3 months to learn ins and outs of python as i practiced on a daily basis approx. 2 hours a day . I used to practice 2 hours in a day . Never missed that deadline. Probably that reason helped me to complete the overall course within 3 months. Also i had simple programming knowledge before starting python but i am saying in that issue, that played a minimal role. All i need is to know what i am going to do with python and by learning python how can i implement python in my related field. Once you get the motivation and know what to do by using tools yo intend to learn i would say then your self motivation lifts you up and your self passion ties you till end of completing task.

How do I become an expert level programmer in a week?,"Day 1: Intro. Read The Art of Computer Programming. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming ] Make sure to do all the exercises. (If you’re slow or crunched for time just do volumes 1–3.)

Day 2: C++. Read and memorize the C++14 standard [ http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4296.pdf ]. Make sure you fully understand lambdas, move semantics and templates.

Day 3: System operator skills. Read all the Linux man pages [ http://man.he.net/ ]. Also, pick your editor. (My personal preference is Emacs [ https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ ].)

Now that you’ve got the basic knowledge it’s time to gain some practical skills…

Day 4: System programmer skills. Implement an OS from scratch. Make sure it supports multiprocessing and some form of reliable transmission protocol as you’ll need this for day 5. (A fully operational TCP/IP stack might be a bit much in a single day, but kudos if you manage it.)

Day 5: Distributed systems/cloud computing. Implement a cloud framework with hardware provisioning, durable storage and a distributed database. Extra credit: metrics, billing, edge cache.

Day 6: App/Web development. Build an app that runs natively on iOS, Android and a traditional web client. (It’s probably fine to skip desktop clients as they’re on their way out.)

How long would it take to master Python?,"Mastering a programming language is not really about mastering the language at all, rather it’s about learning APIs and Libraries used along side the language. It’s about being able to manipulate data efficiently with the language. You can pick up python syntax in minutes, what takes time rather is learning how to efficiently use data structures provided in the language and the libraries that enable you to manipulate these data structures. The better grasp you have for data structures, libraries and APIs, the easier it becomes to solve a particular problem. This ease of solving problems is what constitutes mastering any Programming Language. From my own experience it would take at least 6 months of constant effort to master the use of Python in say Web Development. It would be unreasonable to want to master all aspects of Python - game dev, scientific computing, numerical analysis, machine learning etc. Choose a specific area e.g Web Development and give yourself 2 - 3 years to learn libraries and techniques used in the area.

 * After those years: Staying away from those awesome crazy dynamic features and neat tricks except in the ~1% of cases where they actually make sense to use.
Those number will vary vastly depending on prior programming experience. And there is a variant in step two and three with people coming from other languages trying to force their ways on Python programs. Actually I think some forms of those 3 steps are there in any language.

How much time does it take to master python from scratch?,"I think most answers confuse ‘basics’ with ‘mastering’. So let me clarify few things…

Basic - understanding key concepts of data flow (if, loops, etc.), data structures, oop, exceptions and few others.

Advanced - Being able to navigate freely through the Standard Library and being able to use built-in libraries to their full potential. Being able to use documentation and if needed looking at the source code of the library being used and figuring it out based on code only. Having few large-scale projects (private or commercial) under your belt.

Master - Navigating freely in the whole Python ecosystem, being able to create own libraries, APIs, contributing to development of python through PEP. Thoroughly understanding each concept and programming paradigm (functional/procerdural/oop) and being able to apply it in real-life scenarios. Knowing how Python interacts with underlying OS resources and ability to optimize code for any platform. Being able to approach any problem and leverage built-in or other libraries. Deep understanding would also incline a master to teach others, but it’s not a path for everybody.

Even though it’s true that Python has much shorter learning curve than let’s say Java or C/C++ (I’ve actually learned all of them through the years, not on master level though!) it is still powerful and huge concept to fully grasp. Also, have in mind that programming is not some kind of isolated activity but it’s just one layer of multi-layered modern computer systems architecture. I would argue that you will not be able to become a master in any programming language without understanding operating systems, databases, algorithms, code optimization, testing, code deployment, at least basics to advanced in: hardware architecture, security, networking, and few others.

To answer your question I will take into consideration two most common scenaios:

1. You want to become a self taught python developer, but you currently have another job so have only max 4–5 hours/a day to learn:
2. 
1. Basics: 2–3 months
2. Advanced: 1–5 years
3. Master: 5+ years

3. You don’t have a job or other significant time commitments and can spare 10–12 hours/day on learning:
4. 
1. Basics: 1–2 month
2. Advanced: 6 months–2 years
3. Master: 2+ years

This timelines are approximate. Exact timelines will be based on how quickly you learn in general and if you have any prior understanding of computers at all.

Also bear in mind, that I haven’t mentioned fields like Data Science here. There is a reason for that. This field is huge in itself and becoming good at it requires different skillset and knowledge (maths, data viz, parallel or GPU computing, etc.) so my answer above is only about becoming a master in Python language.

Most of all, please don’t believe that you need some expensive course or university to learn Python (as some answers may suggest). The only thing you need is a basic computer, internet connection and a whole lot of dedication and hard work.

At this point in my career (developer for about 30 years), I’m not really interested in mastering python. But from my previous experience with other languages, if you focus on mastering, I’d say maybe 5 years of continual use with Python would do it.

But mastering a language really doesn’t get you anywhere, unless you are actually working on the language itself - you want to be able to solve problems. Work on other aspects of programming. Heck, mastering your development environment will do more for you…",https://www.quora.com/How-long-would-it-take-to-master-Python?top_ans=65587223,2017-12-07T02:31:58.839814+00:00,,10,Ron Hay,https://www.quora.com/profile/Ron-Hay
How long would it take to master Python?,"This is the question i come across alot and everytime i answer the same.
It's not about whether you can master Python or not, You can master it in one year only but it's not just python. It's about the efficient Programming. Once you have learnt Python, You'd come across a very common problem. Your code would end up taking alot of memory and time. Then you would start learning Data Structure and will ask the same question about data structure. So start learning python along with data structure. That'd be  taking longer than normal python but once you are done with both of them, You'd have actually mastered Python Then.",https://www.quora.com/How-long-would-it-take-to-master-Python?top_ans=14071927,2015-07-16T14:42:23.078044+00:00,,31,Rakesh Verma,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rakesh-Verma-12
How long does it take to learn Python?,"For me it took 3 months! and 219 Pomodoro!

My status before I started:

 * I don’t have any programming background at all.
 * I’m bad at math.
 * I Don’t know what's algoritmes.
 * I don’t know how to learn!
My advice for you:

You need to have two main things: a purpose and to be patient as a mountain! Also, do not rely on your passion or feelings. Because they come and go randomly. Instead, rely on continuous work.

Additionally, you need to learn how to learn! This is very important if you want to be a fast learner. There is a free short course titled Learning how to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects. And if you want to go farther there is also a book called A mind for numbers. Read also chapter 3 from a book called soft skills by John Sonmez about learning. Plus there is a nice youtube video, The first 20 hours. You may want to have a look at it.

Furthermore, you need to vary your resource learning. I mean you need to try learning from many materials like online courses, books, youtube series tutorials, practicing solo!

My experience to learn Python

My purpose was weird! I needed to learn Python to learn java and start programming Android apps, because in the past I jumped to learn java in android platform, java was hell to me! Then I decided to learn an easier language together with the OOP (object-oriented programming principles). Including math and algorithms, it took me three months.

Now I start to learn java and it seems more easier than before (long code but easier in understanding and memories). I’m on my way to seek the Pythonic road! I don’t know why I should still learn Python but this language is addictive :)",https://www.quora.com/How-long-would-it-take-to-master-Python?top_ans=24338276,2016-06-25T07:31:46.051679+00:00,2017-04-23T05:27:12.023127+00:00,1113,Anonymous,
How long did it take you to master Python?,"Been programming in python for 2 years. No where near mastering it.

 * In general Natural Language processing, I use NLTK for lemmatizing to get root words.
 * In my fMRI project on brain image analysis, I use obscure libraries like nibabel, fmri, mvpa for performing multivariate feature analysis.
 * In my speech processing, I needed to downsample my mp3 recordings using ffmpg.
 * In data gathering for most of my data science projects, I need to scrape data from different online sources. I use BeautifulSoup.
 * In my deep learning projects for object recognition, I use Tensorflow and Keras.
There is no way I can make use of all these cool libraries without pulling up the docs. They work so fundamentally different that all the python I know doesn’t make a difference.

"On average, how long does it take for a newbie to learn the general fundamentals and functions of Python if it’s their first language?","I've been learning python for about six months now. Not spending 8 hours a day on it but more as a hobby. 
I started less than a year ago with html, css and javascript. So I did start python with some solid knowledge on what code and programming is about. 
Of course, when starting python, I fell in love with the syntax and simplicity this language offers. It also allowed me to easily learn some complex programming concepts that I am able to use in other languages I sometimes have fun with (for example VBA). 
After six months of python I have had a few projects going on and here are the major things I worked on, chronologically:

1. I created a bot that plays an online game for me. It works recognizing images on the screen and clicking where appropriate. This was a great experience as it was the first ""big"" program I ever wrote.
2. Raspberry pi: working on this one with my brother. We have had different projects. Starting from lighting up lights to a self driving car:
1. ​

​​​our next goal with this one is to add a camera and be able to control the car from a website.
2. OpenPyxl: I use a lot of Excel for work. VBA is a great language but I like being able to do things through python, completely in the dark and once I open excel it magically copied and compared data from different files. So many things happen ""underneath"" that I haven't been able to do with VBA.
3. Django: is what I try to focus on the most more recently. If I want to one day work in the tech industry I believe Web Development is the best route for me to start in. Django is really powerful and starts making sense (I have to say the beginning seemed a little overwhelming because there are a lot of things that need to be understood, as well as the links between those things) to me. I think the fact I started with html, css and javascript is really going to help me out in Django projects so I'm looking forward to the future things I will create.
After 6 months I'm pretty happy with the python level I have reached. I hope I'll manage to double this knowledge in the next six months. And be able to apply as much as possible in my day to day life (current job, personal apps, other projects) on order to keep it as exciting as it has been.

I hope this answer gives you an idea of what the next few months might look like for you.",https://www.quora.com/How-long-would-it-take-to-master-Python?top_ans=20000613,2016-02-27T09:25:40.219988+00:00,2020-06-07T10:48:17.656062+00:00,1464,Pierre Corbin,https://www.quora.com/profile/Pierre-Corbin
How long would it take to master Python?,"Want to Master Python?

On average, learning Python basics takes roughly 8 weeks. Basic syntax, links, if statements, loops, variables, functions, and data types are all covered. How quickly you adapt to the Python language basics depends on how much time you spend learning the language, just as it does with any new programming language. The length of time you spend learning is determined by your schedule, as well as what you want to learn and how much you want to learn.

Learning the fundamentals takes roughly 6-8 weeks on average. This gives you ample time to learn the majority of Python code lines. If you want to become an expert in Python and its field and work in data science, you'll need months or years of study.

The online, as well as classroom courses, claim that someone can learn Python in one or two months, and that is just the beginning; learning Python completely is a difficult and impressive feat that should not be underestimated.

Learning basic Python as a working professional can take a lot longer than learning it as a student. The best way to learn is to join a coding Bootcamp.

Another option is to commit five months to learn Python. For those of you who work full-time, this is for you. It must be planned to spend 2-3 hours a day on the computer. One day you'll learn, and the next day you'll put what you've learned into practice.

This should be done daily to guarantee that you learn consistently and effectively. Complete data science online certification will assist you in mastering python as well as other tools and languages required to compete in this fast-paced business.

Learning Python necessitates commitment and honesty. The learning process is time well spent because it significantly enhances your work prospects.

Python Learning Levels

Learning Python has its own levels.

 * Elementary Python
 * Advanced Python
 * Professional Python
You can learn syntax, keywords, data types, functions, classes, and other things by learning simple Python. An intermediate coder can learn this in around 8 weeks.

Advanced education Multithreading, data synchronization mechanisms, socket programming, socket programming, database programming, and so forth are all included in Python. The nature of the work would determine this. The amount of time it takes to learn these skills is entirely dependent on the learner's ability level.

Professionals in training Data analytics, executing libraries/packages, image processing, and other ideas are all part of the Python language. These are highly sophisticated technology. These strategies can be learned through both online and offline training. Again, depending on the level of the information, learning these complicated procedures can take anywhere from two weeks to a month.

If you are curious about learning python, data science to be in the front of fast-paced technological advancements, check out Mastering Python Program on Ekeeda website and upskill yourself for the future.
